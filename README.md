# Rapid Assessment Tools
Rapid Integrated Assessment (RIA) of national planning documents using machine-based text analysis. This project aims to match paragraphs or sentences from national planing documents with the SDG targets.


Sustainable Development Goals Indicators and Targets
----------------------------------------------------

You can find an excel version of the SDG goals, targets, and indicators on this website: https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/indicators/indicators-list/

The targets are listed on column B of the excel spreadsheet. For example for SDG 1:

Goal 1. End poverty in all its forms everywhere 

Targets: 

1.1 By 2030, eradicate extreme poverty for all people everywhere, currently measured as people living on less than $1.25 a day 

1.2 By 2030, reduce at least by half the proportion of men, women and children of all ages living in poverty in all its dimensions  according to national definitions 

1.3 Implement nationally appropriate social protection systems and measures for all, including floors, and by 2030 achieve substantial coverage of the poor and the vulnerable 

... etc.


Examples
--------

These are some examples of how some organizations have evaluated "MANUALLY" national development plans.

The objective of this project is to conduct a similar analysis but using a computer (COMPUTER-ASSISTED). The computer-assisted analysis will serve as a rapid analysis of a national plan which then can be refined by humans.

>**This is "Rapid Integrated Assessment" for the SDGs for Bhutan. It analyses only one document " is exactly the kind of analysis we seek to reproduce:**

This paper mentions a couple of examples of Rapid Integrated Assessments.

World Bank:
These papers by World Bank staff look at the national plans for a specific country and prepare a 3 page summary.
###Note that these documents below do not compare the national plans to the Sustainable Development Goals, which is the objective of this project.
