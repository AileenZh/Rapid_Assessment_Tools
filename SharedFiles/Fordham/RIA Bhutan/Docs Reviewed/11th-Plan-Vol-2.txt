Our Nation has seen great socio-economic growth but it is more important
that we have growth with equity. We must raise, with all our effort, the less
fortunate so that they may, at the earliest, begin to partake in the opportunities

                     brought by modernization and progress.
The government has provided education to our youth. But for the nation to
prosper for all time, a sound education must be succeeded by access to the right
jobs and responsibilities, so that our youth may bloom as individuals and at the

                       same time serve their Nation well.
The recent Rupee shortage is a serious problem. I feel it is a reminder that, as a
Nation, we must exercise our traditional sense of caution and work even harder
as we address the challenges of the time. For no matter what challenges lie
ahead, it is only the Bhutanese citizen who can protect and safeguard Bhutan.
- His Majesty The King's address to the nation during the 105th National Day

                celebrations, 17th December 2012, in Thimphu.

FORESTS                                      AGRICULTURE
Program Name: National Field Crop Commodity  Phase: Approved
Development Program

Justification:  Domestic production of cereals meets only66% of the total requirement.
Strategy:       Country is only 47% self-sufficient in rice,47% in wheat, 40% is pulses and
                less than10% in oils. However, the country has the potential to increase both
                production and productivity.

                Agriculture is important not only to the rural farming households. It contributes
                significantly to national economy by employing more than 60% of the country's
                population. It also provides important ecological functions and contributes
                significantly in carbon sequestration. It is also the living tradition and culture
                and hence plays very important role in cultural preservation.

                Some of the major challenges to agriculture growth include lack of assured
                irrigation water, predation of crops by wild animals, labour shortages and
                agriculture feminization resulting into low level of agriculture intensity. Steep
                terrain and dispersed settlements are some of the physical challenges affecting
                growth.

                   i. To bring focus on priority commodities to enhance production,
                       commodity program approach will be continued with specific
                       commodity area delineation.

                  ii. Commercialization for potential crops such as rice, maize, wheat and oil
                       seeds will be pursued through PPP/IFD.

                  iii. To achieve the volume for commercialization, land intensification will
                       be emphasized through assured irrigation water and mechanization
                       services.

                  iv. At strategic locations, storage facilities and processing plants will
                       beinstituted.

                   v. Environmentally friendly and socially accepted electric fencing system
                       (EFS) will be promoted, and SLM technologies will be promoted in steep
                       slopes.

                  vi. Research on varieties that are tolerant to biotic and abiotic stress to
                       cope with climate change challenges will be pursued strongly.

                                                                        9

Assessment:        ii. Loss of agriculture land to soil erosion, landslide, flash flood and
Beneficiary:
                        infrastructures development.
                   iii. The climate change impact such as extreme weather condition can

                        perpetuate drought, flood and outbreak of pest and diseases.
                   iv. Cheap import opportunities of cereal grains and other field crops from

                        across the border may also limit participation of private sector.

                    i. At the national level, the successful implementation of the program will
                        reduce dependence on import of cereal, pulses and oil and improve
                        food security and sufficiency levels.

                   ii. At the local level, the program will benefit the farming households by
                        creating meaningful and gainful employment opportunities.

Commodity Development Program

                The demand for horticultural crops to meet nutrition, food and income
                requirement is growing to keep up with increasing population, urbanization
                and disposable incomes. The domestic production especially vegetables is
                increasingly falling behind in meeting the domestic demand. This is resulting in
                growing importation of these products and corresponding trade imbalances. This
                program plans to revert this trend by strengthening the commodity chains of (i)
                vegetables, (ii) citrus, (iii) potato, (iv) fruits & nuts, (v) medicinal, aromatic & spice
Justification:  and (vi) mushrooms with greater emphasis on increasing production for meeting

                domestic requirement and enhancing income through internal trade and export.

Strategy:       This would require the design of interventions that will not only increase
                productivity but also expanding area under cultivation and improving product
                handling/processing across the entire chain. Such interventions will necessarily
                involve systematic widening of all technical, institutional & policy bottlenecks
                which prevent farmers from engaging in increasing productivity.

                 i.National horticultural commodity development program will be implemented
                    by the Dzongkhag & Geog administration with support from different central
                    programs viz. Research & Development Centres, Engineering Division, National

                    commodity programs will be carried out by the commodity coordinators
                    based in Horticulture Division. The program will adopt a strategy which is
                    aimed at improving the national self-sufficiency, especially vegetables by the
                    end of the 11th FYP.

FORESTS                                       Phase: Approved
Program Name: Agriculture Infrastructure De-
velopment

Justification:  The basic infrastructure required to enhance the production of cereals and
Strategy:       horticulture crops is adequate irrigation facilities to meet the crop water
                requirements. The country has a large network of irrigation systems designed
                primarily to meet water demand for paddy cultivation. However, owing to
                inadequate maintenance, use of inappropriate technology and technical
                design, most of these irrigation systems have low water delivery efficiency.
                These problems have resulted in low crop yields. Irrigation infrastructures for
                Kamzhing are virtually non- existent. This land use type constitutes a major part
                of the total arable land and now supports important commercial crops such as
                potato, fruit crops, maize and vegetables. Therefore, continued investment in
                irrigation infrastructure will be required to enhance productivity and production
                of agricultural crops.
                The importance of farm roads requires no emphasis as still about 31% of the
                rural population still reside one hour walking distance from road head.
                i. The Department of Agriculture will plan and implement all major new

                    and rehabilitation projects. Detailed design of the systems will be
                    carried out by the Engineering Division while actual construction will be
                    outsourced to local contractors.

Risk            ii. DoA will also implement storage, pumping and water management
Assessment:          research programs in collaboration with relevant agencies.
Beneficiary:
                iii. In collaboration with Horticulture Division, potential areas for
                     irrigating commercial crops will be identified and appropriate
                     irrigation technologies will be developed.

                iv. To keep abreast of new technologies and enhance knowledge and
                     skills of DoA engineers, a select number of farm road construction
                     and its improvement will also be implemented.

                v. The program will also initiate land development activities in selected
                     Dzongkhags.

                i. Risk of not getting the required minimum additional engineers especially at
                    the RDCs.

                ii. Availability of adequate and timely fund.
                i. The direct beneficiaries of irrigation program will be the farmers owning

                    Chuzhing and those cultivating commercial crops such as potato, orchards,
                    vegetables etc.
                ii. Land development will benefit dry land and orchard owners.
                iii. Farm roads will benefit rural communities, traders and facilitate civil servants
                    and other development organizations in their field activities.

Program Name: National Organic
Development Programme (NOP).

Justification:  Organic farming in Bhutan is still in its infancy but there is growing interest from
                both the Government and the farming communities in developing this potential
                in Bhutan. This is because organic food is increasingly gaining popularity in
                mainstream agriculture around the world with growing global market. It therefore
                presents significant prospects for commercial agriculture as well as for promoting
                sustainable agriculture practices. Organic farming is known to help improve soil
                conditions and land use management for small farms. It can also provide for
                broader income base through diversification of crops. Further, processing and
                marketing of organic agricultural products could also create new off-farm rural
                employment opportunities, especially when export markets can be accessed
                effectively.

                Therefore, given the expected economic and environmental benefits, this
                program will continue to promote and strengthen enabling policy environment
                for the development of organic farming in Bhutan.

Strategy:       i. Category 1 - Naturally organic - will be implemented in remote areas, areas
                  within National Parks and high altitude areas with the objective of conserving
                  watershed, household food and nutrition security and developing integrated
                  self-reliant farming systems.

                ii.Category 2 - will focus on selected areas on selected products linked to potential
                  markets. Production for local markets by farmer groups will be organized to
                  supply local markets with local organic guarantee with Bhutan organic logo for
                  domestic market

Risk            iii. Category 3 - Any area suitable for production, any products identified as
Assessment:       suitable for production for assured market with certification and for exports.
Beneficiary:     i. Having a National Organic Policy will determine the development of organic
                     sector in the future.

                ii. Priority and vision of the government towards organic sector will have direct
                     bearing on the implementation of the planned activities.

                iii. Availability and timely allocation of resources will directly affect the program
                     objectives.

                iv. Coordination within and among the line agencies including private sector will
                     affect market growth

                i. Organic RNR sector
                ii. Small farm holders and commercial organic farmers
                iii. Organic traders

FORESTS                                     Phase: Approved
Program Name: National Livestock Commodity
Development Programme

Justification:  Livestock production in Bhutan mainly includes dairy products, meat, fish and
                poultry products. Over the years, livestock sector witnessed significant progress
                and has contributed significantly to food and nutrition security of the populace.
                However, owing to several constraints and challenges, livestock sector has not
                grown rapidly as it could. A large share of national consumption of livestock
                products are still imported. Latest RNR statistics of 2012 suggest that about 80%
                of national domestic beef consumption requirements are still imported. Similarly,
                about 97% of total fish consumption and 83% of total pork consumption are all
                met from imports.

Strategy:       There is thus considerable potential for expanding livestock production beyond
                subsistence levels in view of the sizeable demand within the domestic market,
                particularly in the major urban centers. Therefore, in consideration of the huge
                potential of the sector to enhance the income generation capacity as well as
                improving the food and nutrition security status of the population, the program
                will continue to focus on creating an enabling environment to boost livestock
                production.

                   i. Institute and strengthen national commodity & service Centers and
                       implement commodity development plans.

                  ii. Pursue pro-poor livestock development initiatives
                  iii. Conduct value chain analysis of livestock commodities
                  iv. Encourage investments in commercial livestock farming
                   v. Explore possibilities of horizontal and vertical integration of mega farms to

                       small producers

opment Programme

Justification:  Highlanders and the nomadic communities play an important role in maintaining
                the integrity of the northern frontiers. However, over the years, the population
Strategy:       of the herders and nomads are reported to be on decline. This is because herding
Risk            in extreme climatic conditions entails hard work with no commensurate gains.
Assessment:     Many of these nomadic communities continue to rely on traditional methods
Beneficiary:    which are highly inefficient, laborious and less productive.
                There is a growing body of evidence suggesting that the herding culture is
                increasingly becoming less attractive among the younger generations. If left
                unchecked, this continual decreasing trend will likely lead to the extinction of
                the nomadic culture and may likely compromise the integrity of the biodiversity
                resources in the high land areas.
                This program therefore will design and implement appropriate interventions that
                not only improves livelihoods of the high land communities but also promotes
                conservation of biodiversity and important watersheds.

                 i. Institute a nodal agency to address the livestock priority needs of nomadic
                     communities;

                ii. Promote efficient management of rangelands and watersheds;
                iii. Promote and support organic livestock production;
                iv. Promote use of alternative energy sources.
                v. Promote eco-tourism and niche product development.

                 i. Limited accessibility to provide coordinated supports.
                ii. Migration & alternative income sources
                iii. Acceptability of planned programs

Program Name: Agriculture Marketing & Phase: Approved
Cooperative Development Program

 Justification:  Farming in Bhutan has largely remained subsistence although the sale of
                 agriculture, livestock and forestry products continues to be a major source of
 Strategy:       income to many of the farmers. As an agrarian society where more than60% of
                 population depend directly on farming, agriculture marketing can play a huge role
 Risk            in the growth and development of farming systems in Bhutan. Nonetheless, in-
 Assessment:     spite of continuous effort by the Government to making the agriculture marketing
 Beneficiary:    system efficient and vibrant, the development of agriculture marketing and trade
                 is still faced with several challenges.

                 Some of the main challenges are paucity of information on commodity prices,
                 deep knowledge gap on demand-supply conditions and market outlet, minimal
                 economy of scale , extremely weak coordination between the Department and
                 other technical Departments, inadequate mechanism for product standardization,
                 grading, packaging and labeling, lack of product differentiation and lack of
                 processing and value addition.

                  i. Department-wise commodity focal persons will be further strengthened
                      in line with the Departments' priorities to cater to the Cooperatives and
                      Marketing needs effectively.

                 ii. Focus on the implementation of the commodity wise programs through the
                      regulation and promotion of farmers groups and cooperatives.

                 iii. The focus, going forward, will be on developing and facilitating linkages
                      and networking between the major markets and the producers/dealers/
                      cooperatives.

                 iv. Conduct strategic market research and studies to the production plan for the
                      potential commercial products.

                 v. Contact farming will continue to receive attention in the11th FYP and will be
                      strengthened and up-scaled to other commodities and clients.

                  i. Market Size: small population and scattered households makes marketing
                      challenging as demand is small coupled with limited scope of economy of
                      scale in production, collection or distribution.

                 ii. Competition with Indian produce/products
                 iii. Ownership of new marketing interventions by farmers and traders
                 i. Farmers
                 ii. Traders/vendors/middlemen/entrepreneurs

                generations are relevant to the emerging issues and challenges.

                  i. Building up appropriate research agenda through consultation considering
                     the One Gewog Three Products (OGTP), area/crop potential and marketability.

                  ii.Conduct regular evaluation and impact studies and use these studies to
                     recommend strategies & policies to enhance land expansion, market,
                     irrigation, farm mechanization and consolidation of agriculture production
                     areas, in the research agenda. Collate feedbacks from various stakeholders
                     of MoAF to respond to various needs and challenges

                 i. Financial resources constraint
                ii. Limited research capability.
                iii. Adoption of technology by the farmers/entrepreneurs

                 i. Farmers in terms of access to upto-date and innovative technologies
                ii. Scientific community
                iii. Agribusiness houses

Beneficiary:    food and nutrition security of school students and help in maintaining the school
                enrollment, particularly in rural communities of Bhutan. In the recent survey
                done by Institute for Management Studies [IMS2010], 49% of the respondents
                reported that SAP offers a great opportunity in school feeding and nutrition,
                especially in schools with boarding facilities.
                Further, program will also prepare the school youths to take up farming on a
                commercial basis and will contribute to lowering the unemployment situation in
                the country.
                 i. SAP will continue to focus on integrated agriculture which includes vegetable

                     production, poultry rearing, dairy, piggery and fishery.
                ii. The program will use the experiences gained from the past to cover more

                     schools under the program in the11th FYP.
                iii. The program will also continue to upscale the farm to school approach in

                     the11th FYP.
                iv. With the view to sustaining the SAP, the program will, during the plan period,

                     work towards including agriculture as one of the subject in the school
                     curriculum.
                 i. Possible conflict with academic schedule and SAP receiving second priority.

Program

Justification:  Although the country's natural environment is relatively pristine, the globally
                significant genetic diversity (both plant and animal) of Bhutan is under increasing
                threat. Introduction of new crop and animal genetic varieties with the aim of
                boosting farm production is expected to adversely impact the local genetic
                resources in the long-run. Further, management of newly introduced varieties
                invariably necessitates new agronomic approaches which would gradually lead
                to the erosion of the age old traditional knowledge and culture associated with
                biological resources. It will therefore be in the interest of Bhutan to conserve
                traditional genetic materials for national food security and resilience to climate
                change.
                Additionally, tapping the potential of biodiversity resources to enhance
                sustainable livelihood would be an effective means of linking environment to
                development. This would require putting in place appropriate legal frameworks
                and institutional capacity to ensure its sustainable use

                i. Implement ex-situ conservation activities in collaboration with other agencies.

                ii. Coordinate in situ conservation of domestic biodiversity in collaboration with
                    farmers, local communities and other stakeholders.

Strategy:       iii. Implement sustainable use program from bio-prospecting and other related
                     perspectives in collaboration with other relevant agencies.

                iv. Strengthen biodiversity information and access to it in collaboration with
                     relevant stakeholders.

                v. Up-grade the center to Directorate to strengthen institutional capacity for
                    effective delivery of the mandates.

Risk            i. Inadequate human resource and technical expertise.
Assessment:     ii. Inadequate support from collaborators.

                iii. Lack of policy support/policy change

Justification:  Bhutan has a rich and varied biological diversity of regional and global impor-
                tance that can be matched by few countries in the world. However, in the pro-
Strategy:       cess of modernizing the Bhutanese economy and with ever increasing exchange
Risk            of biological materials through trade, the status of Bhutan's biodiversity wealth
Assessment:     are increasingly at risk from new pest and diseases. Be this as it may, Bhutan's
Beneficiary:    capacity to effectively manage bio-security issues are relatively under developed.
                Further, as with many developing countries, food safety issues in the country are
                on the rise. An inefficient response to this issue will not only have negative affect
                on the health of the population but will also negatively impact the growth of
                tourism sector in Bhutan. Concurrently, the institutional capacity to manage food
                safety issues in Bhutan is also very weak.

                 i. Strengthen capacity in risk assessment and management as a foundation of
                     bio-security and food safety measures.

                ii. Strengthen regulatory and analytical capacity through upgrading scope of
                     laboratory analyses.

                iii. Infrastructure development in strategic locations/entry points to optimize
                     efficiency of bio-security measures.

                iv. Create mass awareness on roles and stakes of the public in bio-security and
                     food safety activities through educational activities, awareness programmes
                     and certification processes.

                v. Draft/review legislations/standards related to bio-security and food safety

                 i. Unavailability of land for construction of quarantine station, biological pits
                     and offices.

                ii. Shortage of skilled human resource.
                iii. Inadequate funds for containment operation of random incidences of pest

                     and disease epidemics.
                iv. Stakeholder resistance to bio-security and food safety regulatory measures.

                 i. Government institutions/agencies.
                ii. General public.
                iii. Importers, exporters, farmers.

Program Name: Rural Development Training
Programme

Justification:  Farming provides huge prospect for income generation and employment. Rising
                domestic food demand & increasing import of agriculture commodities has
Strategy:       increased the opportunity for rural youth to engage in farming. Besides, it is also
Risk            a priority of the Government to transform farming into a commercial venture.
Assessment:     RDTC therefore, sees huge opportunity in specialized vocational training aimed
Beneficiary:    at enhancing the capacity the farmers and youth to effectively manage farming
                enterprises. Besides, with the registration of farmers groups and cooperatives
                increasing every year, the demand for specialized training has increased rapidly.
                Addressing the capacity gaps of the farmers to manage their farms on a business
                model would contribute to positioning the subsistence farming system on a
                more commercial footing.

                 i. The RDTC will engage with relevant clients in the formulation of training
                     needs and training plans.

                ii. Long duration training that require special facilities will be conducted at the
                     RDT center while short and management level training will be conducted
                     at decentralized locations across the country to facilitate maximum
                     participation, especially the women participants.

                iii. The center will attempt to make farming attractive by means of diversification,
                     mechanization and providing decentralized training, creating interface
                     between financer, promoter and youth.

                 i. Strong urban pull for the rural youths means the targeted population of the
                     programme may not be available as planned.

                ii. Availability of adequate fund on time

                i. Rural Youth;
                ii. Farmer's group and cooperative's office bearers;
                iii. School students and focal agriculture teachers;

SETTLEMENT                                          ROADS
Program Name: Construction and Up-gradation of      Phase: Draft
Southern East-West Highway

Justification:  Recognizing roads as the main economic lifeline, the Government has accorded
                the highest priority to the construction and improvement of primary and
Strategy:       secondary national highways. To this end, the construction of 743 km Southern
Risk            East-West Highway (SEWH) began in 2011. The construction of some segments
Assessment:     of the SEWH comprising of approximately 356 km (approx. 50% of the total
Beneficiary:    length) could not be completed during the 10th FYP. This program will facilitate
                the construction of the remaining segments of the SEWH in the 11FYP. When
                completed, this highway will provide reliable and safe connective infrastructure
                for the Bhutanese commuting between the eastern and western Bhutan and
                vice-versa. The SEWH will also provide linkage to the regional highway network
                such as the Asian Highway Network.

                i. The Department will continue its role of design, supervision, quality control
                     and coordination with the actual construction works contracted out to
                     private sectors.

                ii. With a view to ensure the quality construction and to achieve economy
                     of scale, importance will be given to mechanizing construction activities
                     while continuing to implement environmentally friendly road construction
                     techniques.

                iii. To incentivize the contractors to ensure quality of construction, the
                     Department has initiated awarding construction plus maintenance contracts
                     in the 10FYP. This strategy will be continued in the 11FYP.

                i. Landslide and flash flood.
                ii. Cooperation from the communities.

Northern East-West Highway

Justification:  Being landlocked, Bhutan is heavily dependent on the existing network of national
                highways as the main mode of internal transport. Therefore, safe, reliable and
Strategy:       efficient road-network is crucial for promoting balanced regional development.
                The northern east-west highway is one of the oldest highways and have
Risk            contributed significantly to facilitating the movement of people and goods from
Assessment:     western to eastern region and vice-versa. The highway will continue to serve as
Beneficiary:    the principal mode of internal transport for the people of northeastern, north
                central and north western part of Bhutan. Therefore, sustained investment will
                be required to not only help maintain the highway but also to meet the growing
                demand of larger and heavier transport. This program will continue to improve
                and upgrade the existing highway to facilitate free flow of the traffic, reduce
                travel time and improve safety of the travellers.

                     coordination with the actual construction works contracted to private sector.

                ii. To ensure the quality construction and to achieve economy of scale,
                     importance will be given to mechanizing construction activities while
                     continuing to implement environmentally friendly road construction
                     techniques.

                iii. To incentivize the contractors to ensure quality of construction DoR has
                     initiated awarding construction plus maintenance contracts in the 10th FYP.
                     This strategy will be continued in the 11FYP.

Program Name: Construction/Up gradation of
North-South Highways

Justification:  For a landlocked country, a good network of road and bridges play a critical role
                in facilitating trade, reducing the high cost of transportation normally associated
Strategy:       with mountainous countries and for delivery of socio-economic services
Risk            particularly to scattered and far-off rural communities. The construction of the
Assessment:     first national highway started in 1961. Today, Bhutan has about 9491 kilometers
Beneficiary:    of various categories of roads. The north-south highways have served as an
                important means of transport for promoting trade between northern and
                southern part of Bhutan. These highways are also important for completing
                the national highway grid and serve as the main take-off point for many of the
                existing feeder and farm roads. However, many of the north-south highways
                are highly inefficient, lengthy and susceptible to blocks from natural calamities
                such as landslides and snowfall. Continued investment is therefore required to
                maintain, improve and construct new north-south highways.
                i. DoR will continue its role of design, supervision, quality control and

                     coordination with the actual construction works mostly contracted out to
                     contractors.
                ii. To ensure the quality construction and to achieve economy of scale,
                     importance will be given to mechanizing construction activities while
                     maintaining Environmentally Friendly Road Construction practices.
                i. Landslides and floods;
                ii. Availability of adequate fund on time.

Program Name: Road Asset Management

Justification:  The primary focus of the 10FYP was on expansion of the road network to
                provide accessibility to remote settlements in the country. With the increased
Strategy:       road network, it has become important to maintain the existing road networks,
                especially the national highways to uphold the past capital investments. Research
Risk            in some countries have indicated that the capital investments made by road
Assessment:     agencies to keep a road in good condition comprise of 10 percent of the total
Beneficiary:    cost while 90 percent of the total cost on poor condition roads is borne by road
                users in the form of vehicle operating costs (VOC). It is therefore less expensive
                for road agencies to maintain roads as compared to the VOC costs borne by road
                users due to poor road conditions. Periodic maintenance and management of
                road and bridge infrastructure will form an important activity of the Department
                in the 11FYP.
                i. DoR will continue its role of design, supervision, quality control and

                     coordination with the actual construction works contracted out to private
                     sector.
                ii. To ensure the quality construction and to achieve economy of scale,
                     importance will be given to mechanizing construction/maintenance activities
                     while maintaining environmentally friendly road construction practices.
                iii. The Department will take up mitigation measures to prevent landslides along
                     existing road network and will explore permanent solutions to problematic
                     landslide areas like Rotpashong.

Program Name: Enhancing human settlements  Phase: Draft
in Bhutan

Justification:  The development of human settlement areas has been accorded priority over the
                years but efforts have remained mostly concentrated in urban centers. Increas-
Strategy:       ingly, with the improvements in the living standard of the people, unprecedented
Risk            developments are observed to be taking place outside urban areas as well. Un-
Assessment:     planned infrastructure development in peri-urban and rural areas can adversely
                affect the ambience and beauty of the traditional settlements. Lack of proper
                coordination and planning also leads to wasteful use of resources. There is there-
                fore an urgent need to approach any settlement development plans holistically
                so that it provides a coherent framework to improve the quality of life for all Bhu-
                tanese. This program will work towards meaningfully contributing to maintaining
                and enhancing the quality and diversity of country's natural environment and
                cultural heritage rather than allowing uncontrolled development.

                 i. Legal framework for the spatial planning will be drafted jointly by the local
                     officials and international expert with experience in spatial planning law.

                ii. Existing rules and regulations shall be reviewed to suit the changing needs.

                iii. The department will undertake settlement planning as an activity from the
                     outset of development.

                 i. Cooperation from the stakeholders;
                ii. Lack of competent professionals;
                iii. Adequate and time availability of fund.

Beneficiary: Whole settlement of the country.

Program Name: Engineering adaptation for  Phase: Draft
disaster risk reduction

Justification:  As the rivers flow towards the southern foothills, the transition from mountainous
                areas to flat plains typically occurs and is accompanied by extensive flooding. On
Strategy:       the other hand, due to erratic rainfall pattern and unusually heavier precipitation,
Risk            flooding in northern Bhutan is becoming a regular phenomenon. Flash flood
Assessment:     carrying sizeable amounts of boulders and debris causes substantial damage
Beneficiary:    and loss of lives from time to time. With climate change and degradation of
                environment, such incidences are expected to increase in the coming years.
                Therefore, it is urgently important to minimize the impacts of floods on human
                safety, health and welfare by designing interventions aimed at managing the
                risk posed by flood and other natural disasters. To this end, this program will
                formulate and implement various policies and regulations related to engineering
                aspects adaption to natural hazards and create conducive environment for
                integrating the best engineering technologies.
                i. FEMD under DES will lead as the primary institution responsible for flood risk

                    alleviation works to protect all communities under the threat of flood.
                ii.Scattered data on water resources will be consolidated on database which

                    would be the basis for mathematical modeling and production of Flood Risk
                    maps.
                iii.Flood management projects on major rivers will be implemented to ensure an
                    integrated river basin management strategy, while the local governments will
                    take up minor flood protection scheme. EARRD continue its work on capacity
                    development, technology promotion, quality assurance and risk reduction.
                i. Lack of appropriate data.
                ii. Risk of flooding during construction phase.

construction and maintenance of trail
suspension bridges

Justification:  Over the past years, Government has made huge investment in the construction
                of highways, farm roads and bridges. However, there are still many rural
                communities who use mule tracks, traditionally used trails and suspension bridges
                as the principle means of communication. Enhancing accessibility through the
                development of appropriate connective infrastructure will therefore contribute
                immensely to the reduction of rural poverty in the 11th FYP.

Strategy:       Further, many of the important traditional routes have connection to the age old
                culture and tradition of Bhutan. Maintaining and improving these infrastructures
Risk            will not only help in conserving our cultural heritage but will also contribute
Assessment:     greatly to promoting green tourism in Bhutan.
Beneficiary:
                 i. Rural Infrastructure Services Division (RISD) will closely work with the
                      Dzongkhags and the Local Governments in carrying out the surveying,
                      designing, cost estimating and preparation of drawings.

                ii. The Local Governments and the beneficiaries will carry out the actual
                      implementation. RISD will continuously provide technical backstopping at
                      various stages of construction.

                iii. The designs for the Bazams will be carried out by the Ministry in consultation
                      with the Division for Conservation of Heritage Sites, MoHCA.

                i. Local Governments may accord low priority to the program.

Justification:  Over the last decade, Bhutan has experienced a very rapid pace of urbanization.
                Additionally, with current pace of rural-urban migration, urban populations are
Strategy:       projected to rise significantly while on the contrary there will be fewer people
Risk            living in the rural areas. With unprecedented influx of people to urban areas,
Assessment:     the major urban centers have already started to experience the adverse effect
Beneficiary:    of urbanization. Conversely, rural areas are starting to become empty, giving
                rise to problems such as farm labor shortages, feminization of agricultural
                labor force and declining agriculture production. Managing urban development
                efficiently and effectively to build and sustain a quality urban environment is
                thus very crucial. This program is formulated to promote urban infrastructure
                development in the most cost effective manner while ensuring high live-ability.
                Besides, as a means towards spreading development across the region, proper
                development of regional hubs will be implemented.
                i. Devise and implement urban development plans for regional growth centers

                     and major towns in accordance with the National Spatial Planning Policy and
                     National Urbanization Strategy.
                ii. Decentralize project implementation to the respective Municipalities/LGs
                     with technical backstopping and assistance provided by Department.
                iii. Promote and encourage private investors or PPP whenever commercially
                     viable to implement urban development activities.
                iv. Promote and maintain aspects that best reflect the best of Bhutanese
                     values, aesthetics and traditional architecture and that is in harmony with
                     the natural environment.
                i. Poor detailed design of sub-projects
                ii. Lack of experienced contractors, poor performance of contractors, poor
                     supervision and quality control of works.
                iii. Lack of suitably trained professionals and contractors.
                iv. Availability of fund.

Program Name: Geological Mapping,            Phase: Approved
Mineral Exploration and Sustainable Mineral
Development

Justification:  Bhutan has pursued mining activities cautiously bearing in mind the social and
                environmental consequences. The sector is, therefore, still underdeveloped.
Strategy:       While Bhutan has significant deposits of a number of mineral resources, including
Risk            limestone, coal, graphite, gypsum, slate and dolomite, most mining activities are
Assessment:     limited to relatively small operations and mainly involve the above minerals. All
Beneficiary:    the mines in the country are operated using opencast mining technique.
                Several constraints and challenges have impeded the development of mining
                sector in Bhutan. The absence of a clear mineral development policy has
                hampered the management, allocation and monitoring of mines. Similarly, the
                sector also faces human resource constraints both in the government and the
                private mining sector which has hampered its effective functioning. Despite the
                problems, mining will continue to be an important source of revenue and it would
                be in the interest of Bhutan to manage these resources sustainably.
                Taking Bhutan's current pace of socio-economic development into an account,
                the demand for industrial minerals and construction materials will highly increase
                over the next few decades and therefore, mineral sector will continue to play
                an important role for Bhutan's socio-economic development as envisaged by
                Economic Development Policy (EDP) 2010. For a mountainous country like ours
                where substantially towards Gross Domestic Product (GDP) has become necessity.
                Mining and mineral based industries has been an important source of foreign
                exchange and fiscal receipts for the government. These industries have
                contributed by ways of taxes, employment, wealth creation, exports, spill over to
                other businesses and helped diversify the economy.

                  i. Prioritize the target areas for mineral investigation and construction materials
                     study during the annual activity plan formulation.

                  ii. Implementation of geological investigation of heavy minerals will be
                     accorded priority.

                  iii. In the interest of ensuring the sustainable mineral development, the
                     department will further strengthen both technical and human capacity of
                     both government and private sectors.

                  iv. Scientific mining will be ensured through improvement of the regulatory
                     framework and its implementation.

                 i. Inadequate human resources and technical capacity.
                ii. Inadequate financial resources

Beneficiary:    scientific studies and geo-hazard risk assessment is therefore needed to address
                and manage the potential threat posed by these geo-hazards. Improving human
                security and safety through effective mitigating and management of climate
                change induced and geological hazards will be the primary objective of the
                program.

                     pilot areas.

                iii. Conduct validation of potentially dangerous lakes in the northern frontiers
                     of Bhutan Himalayas.

                iv. Implement the landslide mitigation of critical areas under the UNDP-NAPA
                     project.

                v. Conduct Hazard assessment of the old dzongs, monasteries and new urban
                     centers.

Beneficiary:    micro enterprises. As importantly, the sector has also contributed immensely to
                strengthening Bhutan's image and identity around the world.

                Recognizing its huge growth potential, Bhutan has, over the years, promoted
                itself as an exclusive long-stay destination for tourist. In-order to sustainable
                harness the sectors prospects for Bhutan's development, the sector will have
                to continue to address several bottlenecks and challenges impeding its growth.
                Some of the main ones include developing adequate tourism infrastructure,
                distribution of tourism benefits to wider population, diversifying tourist
                products and minimizing the impact of growing tourist on Bhutan's culture and
                environment.

                   spread of tourism, improving quality and standards of services including ac-
                   commodation, broadening the demand base by identifying new source, in-
                   creasing community participation, developing and upgrading tourism human
                   resources, and improving infrastructure through promoting PPP.
                 i. Occurrence of global or regional economic and financial crisis.

Justification:  There is increasing demand to provide the reliable and useable data/information
                on weather, climate and water related services to satisfy the increasing multi-
Strategy:       facet requirement of end users. In particular hydrological information provides a
Risk            scientific basis& basic inputs for any socio-economic planning and development
Assessment:     sectors like hydropower, industry, agriculture, construction, tourism,
Beneficiary:    transportation etc.
                The hydrological and flood warning/GLOF early warning networks and stations
                will serve the major solution in enhancing the capacity to manage and mitigate
                the climate change induced disasters like floods, landslide, and droughts. Further,
                better understanding of natural disaster of hydrological origins require adequate
                multi-tier observation network for in-situ data collection in real and near real
                time to provide reliable flood forecasting and early warning to safe guard the life
                and properties. This program will continue to put in place effective institutional
                structure to respond to such disasters.

                     international organizations/institutions.
                 i. Risk of getting land in time;
                ii. Lack of support & cooperation from local government & relevant agencies
                     to implement the programs;
                iii. Non-delivery of equipment on time by suppliers

Meteorological Network Coverage and
Enhancing
Weather and Climate Information Services

Justification:  Correct information on weather and climatic conditions is required for socio-
Strategy:       economic growth and environment friendly development. The generation of
Risk            timely meteorological information is therefore important for facilitating sound
Assessment:     socio-economic planning and development. Reliable and real-time forecasting
                information will also help in protecting lives and properties through early warning
                services.
                Further, climate data are required for climate modeling & climate change studies.
                Considering the topography of the country, a dense climate monitoring network
                is essential to forecast and study the impact of climate change. The current
                observation network in Bhutan is inadequate in terms of spatial coverage and
                representativeness. Hence, strengthening of its coverage with increasing number
                of hydro-meteorological hazards and well equipped meteorological monitoring
                stations will be essential to manage the increasing risk posed by climate change.

                 i. Timely maintenance of stations to improve data collection.
                ii. Advocacy programs to increase public/stakeholders/end users interests on

                     hydro-met products and services
                iii. Promote collaboration with relevant international/national research institu-

                     tions/organizations for technical HR capacity developments.
                iv. Promote ICT-enabled data collection, transmissions and information dissem-

                     inations to end users.
                v. Translate the technical and scientific information into formats readily under-

                     stood by general public through appropriate media and train media persons
                     for proper broadcasting & advocate on hydro-met services.

Beneficiary:    crucial. Equally, It would also be important to sustain the huge investment made
                for the hydropower plants in the past. All of these would warrant continuous
                institutional reforms and strengthening of the energy sector to cope with difficult
                challenges.
                This program is therefore designed to strengthen the institutional capacity of the
                energy sector to deliver the mandate of 10,000 MW installed capacity by 2020
                and ensure its sustainability.
                 i. Carry out institutional capacity assessments to identify gaps and deficiencies.

Assessment:     order to realize the plan objective of self-reliant economy and electricity for all,
Beneficiary:    accelerating hydropower development is the way forward. It will be therefore be
                appropriate to expeditiously conduct detailed project reports for the potential
                projects and implement them using sustainable business model.
                Further, to keep pace with the accelerated hydropower development, power
                transmission infrastructure (both lines and substations) will require strengthening
                to evacuate power from the generating stations to various load centers. Therefore,
                a full electricity grid interconnection between the western, central and eastern
                region will be necessary to ensure reliable and adequate power supply to the
                consumers. This is will also contribute towards the goal of making Bhutan energy

Justification:  Energy is deeply fundamental to improving the quality of life. At the national
                level, energy is an essential and key ingredient for sustainable development.
Strategy:       Therefore, better and enhanced access to reliable energy services can greatly
                help in alleviating poverty through reduction in workloads of poor households,
Risk            improving living conditions and enhancing opportunities to engage in productive
Assessment:     activities. As such, Bhutan has made huge investment in the development of
Beneficiary:    hydro power plants. In order to promote and sustain energy security and
                mitigate of risk of relying on one energy source, it will be crucial to explore other
                renewable energy sources.
                This program therefore aims to diversify energy supply mix using renewable
                energy resources like solar, wind, biomass, small hydro and other emerging
                modern fuels as sources for energy generation and strengthen the institutional
                capacity for provision of efficient and responsive energy services.

                 i. Develop Renewable Energy Master Plan, conduct pre-feasibility and
                     feasibility studies to attract the investors in the renewable energy Sector.

                ii. Shape energy demand by promoting the use of efficient technologies,
                     processes, products, standards and labels at all levels of supply and demand
                     chain.

                iii. Promote biogas plants as alternate source of fuel for cooking, Compact
                     Fluorescent Lamp (CFL) instead of incandescent lamps in the LV category
                     consumers, energy efficient wood stoves to reduce fuel-wood demand and
                     solar water heating systems as alternative means for heating water and
                     space.

                iv. Link the supply and demand side for energy services by identifying
                     technologies and process that are applicable in Bhutan or in Bhutanese
                     context by conducting adaptive research activities.

                 i. Inherent high cost of energy generation from the renewable energy sources
                     like solar, wind, and biomass technologies.

                ii. Scattered nature of settlements and daunting challenge both in terms of
                     economic and technological aspects for renewable energy

                iii. Availability of functional laboratory for research activities and testing &
                     certification of energy efficient products.

                 i. Rural population,
                ii. Renewable energy based companies

Market Access

Justification:  Trade has become increasingly significant for overall socio-economic
                development of our country. However, due to small domestic market and narrow
Strategy:       range of exports, the trade sector could not grow as expected. Over the years,
Risk            the Department has been making concerted efforts towards development and
Assessment:     diversification of our export base and realized that in order to optimally harness
Beneficiary:    the relative comparative advantage, it would be important to strategically
                enhance our export capacity in the international market through export
                promotion, niche marketing and facilitating integration into the regional and
                international trading regime.
                Moving forward, given the importance of the trade sector in employment
                generation, economic diversification and in addressing the growing trade
                imbalances, growth and development of trade sector has now become very
                crucial In light of the above, the Department will continue strengthen and
                sharpen its focus on diversifying exports and expansion of export markets.

                  i. Continue to organize and attend annual consultation and bilateral meetings
                     to resolve/address trade related issues. Also explore Preferential Trade
                     Agreement with Nepal, Thailand and continue negotiations on SAFTA and
                     BIMSTEC.

                  ii.Capitalizing on Bhutan's LDC status, engage at the multilateral level for special
                     & differential treatment in terms of market access and technical assistance.

                  iii. Brand Bhutan will be operationalized to accelerate export and will
                     accord priority to the development of dry ports.

                  iv. Sharpen its engagement in trade fairs, organize trade missions,
                     undertake market study for selected products and have an export showroom
                     to exhibit the export products.

                  i. The possible change in Government policy on bilateral relations with trading
                     partners and trade policy may hamper the implementation of the bilateral
                     trade.

                  ii.Regional trade agreements depend on the consensus of the member states.
                     As such, political situation and change in foreign trade policies of the member
                     states may stall or affect the progress.

                  iii. The land acquisition process entails various stakeholders and agencies
                     which may impede the work process.

                  iv. Lack of budget may hamper the progress.

                 i. Local Government and BCCI

and Regulatory Framework

Justification:  Legal instruments such as consumer protection act, competition policy, and trade
Strategy:       development act have been drafted to prevent business malpractices, promote
                fair competition in the market and promote international best practices in the
Risk            business environment. However, the implementation of the laws and policies
Assessment:     through the revised rules and regulations would be a challenging task. To achieve
Beneficiary:    greater economic efficiency and healthy competition in the trading sector,
                it is important to continue the efforts of the Department aimed at creating a
                conducive and enabling environment. This would, amongst others, require
                development of the managerial skills of the entrepreneurs and improving the
                efficiency and productivity of the business operations.
                This program is therefore designed to improve the institutional performance of
                the trade sector to effectively respond to the impending challenges.

                  i. In order to implement the Consumer Protection Act, an independent office
                       with required manpower under the Ministry will be created.

                  ii. The legal framework will be strengthened through the drafting and
                       enactment of the competition law/policy and trade development act.

                  iii. Under the market modernization, trainings on skills development and
                       awareness on consumer products will be carried out throughout the
                       country. The training will focus mostly on micro traders.

                  iv. To strengthen trade, feasibility study on establishment of wholesale
                       centres in all border towns will be carried out. Further, the Department will
                       strengthen the monitoring of trading activities within the country.

                  v. In the area of up-gradation of the fuel quality, negotiation with oil
                       companies in India & Government of India for early launch of Euro IV fuel
                       will be initiated expeditiously.

                 i. Implementation of Consumer Protection Act, Development of Competition
                      Policy/Law and Trade Development Act might face budget constraint as
                      there is no committed budget from any donor agencies.

                 ii. The relocation of the POL depot entails huge cost and lack of committed
                      budget may deter the relocation work.

                iii. Lack of adequate skilled professionals might impede the implementation
                      of the above activities

Assessment:     productive employment opportunities, vibrant private sector growth and
Beneficiary:    economic diversification. The economy continues to be driven by hydropower and
                construction sectors with limited potential for employment creation. Besides,
                small domestic market, difficult terrain, high transportation costs, lack of skilled

environment and institutional capacity

Justification:  The manufacturing and industries sector has not grown as rapidly as expected.
                The sector is constrained by various factors that impede its further development.
Strategy:       Bhutan's industries have been affected by low levels of productivity, little or no
Risk            technological advancement and low levels of human capacity. The relatively slow-
Assessment:     er growth and performance the sector can largely be attributed to inadequate or
Beneficiary:    lack of clear and coherent industrial policy and strategy. While the development
                of the Economic Development Policy in 2010 has provided the roadmap as to the
                development of industries, the implementation of the policy has remained rela-
                tively weak. Further, the International Finance Corporation/World Bank report on
                `Ease of Doing Business' ranked Bhutan 142 of 183 countries, clearly highlighting
                the deficiencies that needs to be addressed going forward.
                There is therefore, the need to further strengthen the policy environment and
                institutional capacity of the sector to enhance its effectiveness and efficiency in
                the delivery of its service.

Small Industry in Bhutan                Phase: Approved

Justification:  There is a growing body of evidence suggesting cottage and small scale industries
                as an engine of economic and employment growth. Development of cottage,
Strategy:       micro and small industries is increasingly recognized as an effective instrument
Risk            for promoting balanced regional development. Given its high relevance and po-
Assessment:     tential in nurturing inclusive development in Bhutan, the government during the
                10th FYP established the Department of Cottage and Small Industry (DCSI) to
                propel the growth and development of the CSI sector. In working towards pro-
                moting an effective CSI sector, it will be crucial to address several constraints and
                challenges impeding the growth of the sector. These challenges relate to limited
                access to finance by the CSIs, difficulty to access viable markets, limited industrial
                infrastructure, limited entrepreneurial talent/skills, use of outmoded technology,
                high transportation costs, low economy of scale and, poor R&D and innovation
                culture among enterprises.
                This program will work towards improving the performance of the private sector
                development through galvanizing cottage and small industries for industrial and
                employment generation.

                 i. Strengthen the Policy Environment and Institutional Framework.
                ii. Strengthen the Legislative Framework and Enterprise Environment.
                iii. Facilitate Access to Finance and Incentive;

COMMUNICATIONS                           Phase: Draft
Program Name: Expension & Strengthening
of Air Transport

Justification:  Paro International Airport as the only international airport in the country
                provides the critical transportation link with the rest of the world. Over the years,
Strategy:       passenger volume has increased and air traffic has been growing at the rate of 15
Risk            % per annum. This has caused a lot of congestion in the terminal affecting proper
Assessment:     delivery of air services and also significantly increasing security issues. Domestic
Beneficiary:    airports are vital and strategic infrastructure on which the tourism and other
                economic sectors depend upon. It also supports regionally balanced development.
                In the 10th Plan, three domestic airports were established within minimum
                infrastructure. In order to operationalize the domestic airports optimally, major
                investments have to be made to expand the services and security features such as
                taxiways, aprons, security installations, equipment etc. Institutionally DCA has
                been tasked with both the regulatory and service provider role which has been
                resulting in conflict of interest.
                i. To deliver their services better, the regulatory role and service provider

                     responsibilities will be bifurcated. This will promote better service delivery
                     and standards.
                ii. Given the passenger traffic congestion in Paro International Airport,
                      investments to expand it will be made.
                iii. The three domestic airports will be made fully operational by enhancing
                      security features, improving drainage and access, and aviation facilities. This
                      will allow for safer and faster transportation links to other regions of the
                      country, thereby facilitating regionally balanced development.
                iv. HR will be strengthened to achieve LEI targets
                i) Airlines may not be able to procure smaller aircraft to operate in STOL
                     airstrips.
                ii) International airlines may be reluctant to operate into Paro.
                iii) Resource constraints may not hinder implementation of plan.
                iv) Unavailability of land replacement may affect the expansion works of PIA.
                v) Inadequate trained staff which may affect achievement of LEI percentage to
                     meet the minimum acceptable level of ICAO.

Justification:  Safe and efficient transportation is an enabler for socio-economic development.
                Road transportation in Bhutan which is the primary mode of transportation
Strategy:       is very expensive due to the mountainous terrain. This coupled with small
Risk            domestic market for public transportation, on most routes, makes provision of
Assessment:     public transportation commercially unviable. While the road infrastructure has
Beneficiary:    expanded, many rural folks are unable to capitalize on it due to lack of affordable
                transportation.
                Road safety and traffic congestion still remains a critical issues that needs to be
                addressed. Bhutan has the highest road fatality cases in the region which can be
                attributed mostly to limited enforcement of traffic rules, and poor geometrics
                of road. The urgency and the need to explore alternative modes of transport, as
                well as to implement urban transport systems has increased evermore with the
                rising cost of fuels, increased vehicle numbers and for carbon emission controls.
                i. Improve accessibility, affordability and reliability of urban and inter-district/
                regional passenger and goods transport through provision of subsidies for public
                transportation and enhanced monitoring of transport services.
                ii. Reduce road fatalities through strengthened enforcement, road safety
                advocacy and trainings.
                iii. Provide access to transport for differently-abled citizens
                iv. Promote use of eco-efficient vehicles, explore alternative transport such as rope
                ways, water ways and railways where feasible
                i. Inadequate financial resources which will hamper the implementation of plans
                ii. Inadequate human resources which may lead to partial or incomplete
                implementation of plans.
                iii. Transportation being a cross cutting issue, lack of support from other key
                stakeholders may jeopardize the achievements of outcomes
                All road users and those availing public and private public transportation within
                the country.

Development of Media

Justification:  The Bhutanese society has largely been an oral society with limited documen-
                tation. In this age of information and with the introduction of Parliamentary
Strategy:       democracy, media is expected to play the role of informing the public and acting
Risk            as a watch dog. Also media is an effective way to improve transparency and pro-
Assessment:     mote our culture and traditions.
Beneficiary:    The media in Bhutan is a relatively new sector with few trained professionals and
                having issues of sustainability of private media firms due to the limited domestic
                market for media products. Also overall access to media is very low at 55%. The
                legal and policy frameworks are not fully established which leads to challenges in
                trying to regulate the media sector.
                i. Strengthening the capacity of media to help them report comprehensively and
                professionally
                ii. Strengthening policy and regulatory frameworks to facilitate the development
                of media sector
                iii. Facilitating private sector participation in building key infrastructure for
                multi-media to reduce overheads and improve viability of their projects
                i. Lack of professional/technical expertise

                ii. Insufficient Resources
                iii. Terms not attractive or clear for PPP
                iv. Resistance of agency to introduction of new policies and regulations
                i. General Public

Program Name: Strengthen quality and  Phase: Draft
content of BBSC TV and Radio

Justification:  To strengthen the reliability of BBS Radio and Television news and programme, it
                is important to strengthen the terrestrial services of BBS. By establishing satellite
Strategy:       earth and regional bureau connectivity, BBS would be able to broadcast news and
Risk            programme produced in different parts of the country very efficiently.
Assessment:     Technology is a key component in the improving and expanding content through
Beneficiary:    automation of Radio studios and procurement of professional equipment.
                Given the limited capacities of BBS, improvement of the content of TV and
                radio programmes also depends on acquiring and broadcasting locally produced
                programmes and films. To provide regionally produced news and programmes,
                establishment of regional studio at Kanglung is necessary. It will also substitute
                the HQ in case of emergency. Professional enhancement of staff is also critical
                for quality of content. Further to preserve programme and news for future
                referencing, establishment of professional video archive is very important.
                i.Strengthen reliability of BBS radio and Television by installing FM/TV

                   transmitters at strategic locations and connecting the Regional Bureaus with
                   the HQ through E1 link.
                ii.Improve and expand content of BBS radio and Television by constructing
                   Radio and TV studios at Kanglung, purchasing locally produced programmes,
                   purchase of professional equipment and enhance the capacity of the staff
                   through relevant HRD programmes.
                i. Not being able to carry out required land acquisition in time which will affect

                      construction of studio.
                ii. Unable to acquire befitting programs to meet the audience satisfaction.
                iii. Resource gap to meet the international and domestic standard and quality.
                iv. Inadequate number of staff being provided which will affect implementation

                      of plans.

Program Name: Access and Sustainability of  EDUCATION
School Education                            Phase: Approved

Justification:  Recent statistics shows that good progress has been achieved in providing access to
Strategy:       education. Gender parity has been achieved at primary and secondary education
Risk            level, while it is improving at higher secondary and tertiary level. The current
Assessment:     challenge is providing the proverbial "last mile access" to achieve Universal Primary
                Education. It is estimated that about 2% of primary school age children are not
                in school. These are children from i) remote and hard to reach area; ii) migrant
                population; and iii) the urban poor including those with special needs.
                The past Five Year Plans saw rapid expansion of school infrastructure to provide
                access to education. Today, the situation is one where student numbers, especially
                in rural areas, are declining at primary and secondary levels while demand for
                higher secondary and tertiary education is increasing. This demand cannot be met
                without further investments in school infrastructure. Furthermore, the phasing
                out of donor assistance has posed numerous challenges in terms of sustainability
                of some of its important programmes.
                i. Rationalize small, unsustainable schools where enrolment is low and is likely

                     to decline further.
                ii. Consolidate schools with boarding, bussing services allowing for a critical

                     mass of students that warrants better investments and facilitates provision
                     of resource.
                iii. Strengthen Special Education Services for improving access to schools and
                     ECCD programmes for better preparedness for new entrants to primary
                     schools.
                iv. Facilitate the establishment of private schools and international schools to
                     develop a more sustainable education system and promote Bhutan as an
                     educational hub.
                v. Improve disaster preparedness and response in schools
                vi. Improve preparedness for donor phasing out by developing an Action Plan
                     for replacing WFP's school feeding.
                i. The continuing teacher shortage in remote schools may affect the proper
                    functioning of schools.
                ii. If adequate budget is not provided, it will affect the implementation of the
                    capital intensive school consolidation plans.
                iii.If reliable data on out-of-school children is not available, it will affect evidence-
                    based planning and decision-making
                iv.Overall human resource shortages both teaching and management should
                    affect the implementation of the plan

Beneficiary:    Students, teachers, parents, of school going children, NFE learners and the wider
                community.

Au Name: MINISTRY OF EDUCATION          Department: DEPARTMENT OF SCHOOL
Program Name: Relevance and Quality of  EDUCATION
School Education                        Phase: Approved

Justification:  Access to education must be accompanied and supported by quality in the
                contents of education. In an increasingly globalized and fast changing world, the
Strategy:       education system should not only provide students with the highest standards
Risk            of learning but also inculcate in them the right values, attitudes and skills so that
Assessment:     they are able to lead a happy and productive life.
Beneficiary:    Although no empirical study has been conducted, there are concerns that the
                quality of education in Bhutan has declined over the years. Therefore, this
                Programme complemented by the Teachers Support Services Programme aims to
                improve relevance and quality of education and support the national aspiration

                to become a knowledge-based society.

                i. Strengthen the performance management system in schools to ensure
                      that teachers are performing optimally, thereby resulting in better learning
                      outcomes for students. This includes developing an ICT system to make it
                      efficient and tamper proof.

                ii. Implement the "Educating for GNH initiative" to ensure the philosophy of
                      GNH permeates every aspect of the school.

                iii. Develop and implement the ICT Masterplan to ensure that students are
                      equipped with ICT skills and knowledge as an important aspect of their
                      learning.

                i. Adequate human resources especially technical expertise to maintain the
                      IT services, not being available will jeopardize the implementation of this
                      programme

                ii. Unavailability of teachers to serve in remote schools will negatively impact
                      the student's education

                iii. Unavailability of resources, including those traditionally supported by
                      Development Partners will impact delivery of those activities.

                Students, teachers, parents of school going children and the wider community.

Program Name: Curriculum Research and  RESEARCH & DEVELOPMENT
Development                            Phase: Approved

Justification:  The quality of the school curriculum and its implementation broadly determines
                the quality of the learning outcomes for students. In the long term, it will have
Strategy:       a strong bearing on the overall quality of human resources of the country. A
Risk            curriculum of good quality and standards will help the future leaders of our
Assessment:     country to navigate the Nation through the 21st century.
Beneficiary:    A well trained group of curriculum developers would be able to weigh the
                curriculum through various dimensions. Well trained teachers supported with
                relevant resources and professional development programmes, will achieve the
                intent of the curriculum. Currently the department suffers from shortage of staff
                with expertise in curriculum development and lacks a strong and institutionalized
                system for monitoring and co-ordination of the introduction of new curricula.

                i. Strengthen the existing curriculum for all subjects making it relevant and
                      meaningful. This will be implemented through close co-ordination and
                      consultation with all relevant stakeholders and based on scientific review.

                ii. Invest in building capacities of curriculum officers and ensure their expertise
                      is recognized by RCSC in their management of specialists and professionals.
                      This is to ensure that their expertise continues to benefit the department.

                iii. Strengthen the management system for introducing and monitoring the new
                      curricula.

                i. Continued shortage of both Curriculum Officers and other staff in the
                      Department, pose a risk of not being able to implement activities effectively.

                ii. Lack of training in curriculum design and publishing for the staff is a major
                      problem and as such our work needs to be outsourced on many occasions.
                      Outsourcing is also not very effective.

Justification:  Higher education is essential for the development of human capital of any
                country. Given that Bhutan seeks to pursue the objective transforming into a
Strategy:       knowledge-based society, investments in higher education opportunities are
Risk            vital. Furthermore skilled and specialized human resources are required for
Assessment:     providing services in all sectors, especially in the health, technical and education
Beneficiary:    sector. This continues to be addressed through scholarships in important areas/
                studies.
                Moreover investments into expanding access to primary and secondary
                education have resulted in growing numbers of Bhutanese students seeking
                higher education every year. Being unable to accommodate all the students,
                many Bhutanese students pursue their tertiary education outside the country,
                many in institutions of questionable repute. Facilitating the establishment of
                reputable tertiary education institutes will also address this issue.
                i. Strengthen the regulatory framework and quality assurance systems to

                      facilitate establishment of quality tertiary education institutions (TEIs).
                ii. Enhance the strategic planning and monitoring system for scholarships to

                      ensure scholarships are well aligned to national needs, managed effectively
                      with sustainability as a key question being addressed.
                iii. Strengthen services such as information and advisory services to students,
                      as well as facilitating linkages for TEIs such as accreditations etc.
                iv. Encourage participation of girls in tertiary education through policy and
                      other interventions.

                i. Lack of adequate resources to implement the programme especially the
                    scholarship activities which are largely dependent on development partners.

                ii. Adequate human resources with necessary skills and knowledge to manage
                    tertiary education may not be available which will seriously affect the
                    implementation of the entire programme

                Direct beneficiaries will be aspiring and meritorious students seeking tertiary
                education. Other beneficiaries will be the existing tertiary education institutions,
                private investors and companies seeking to set up TEIs, corporations, community
                and the country at large.

Program Name: Adult Literacy and Lifelong  HIGHER EDUCATION
Learning                                   Phase: Approved

Justification:  Literacy is seen as one of the key instruments for poverty alleviation and thus
                the achievement our development philosophy of GNH. The government started
Strategy:       the non-formal education programme in 1991 to provide basic literacy and
Risk            functional skills to the adult population. The programme has been very effective
Assessment:     in providing literacy to our illiterate population bringing adult literacy 52.8% in
Beneficiary:    2005 to 55.3% in 2012. Undoubtedly literacy has played a big role improving
                their lives, providing access to information, knowledge. It has also empowered
                the communities to participate in developmental activities, decision-making and
                the political process.
                In the 11th Plan, the primary focus will be to enhance the adult literacy rate
                to 70%. To achieve this, there has to be a two-pronged approach of enhancing
                access to education as well as improving the quality through augementing the
                skills of the instructors Community Learning Centres. Furthermore, the NFE
                curriculum will need to be revamped to include life skills and other relevant skills,
                which it currently lacks. In order to institute s system of continuous learning,
                opportunities will need to be provided to those who could not continue formal
                education and wish to upgrade their qualifications through the continuing
                education programme.

                  i. Enhance NFE curriculum by including a functional English curriculum and
                       other life skills, and developing an equivalency framework.

                  ii. Improve the quality of NFE instructors by building their capacities
                 iii. Revitalize Community Learning Centres with provision of basic equipment

                       and other resources.
                 iv. Strengthen monitoring and review system for the Non Formal Education

                       through literacy mapping to target key geographical areas where illiteracy
                       rates are high and also close monitoring of current activities to facilitate
                       sharper interventions.
                  v. Facilitate provision of Continuing Education Programme to support
                       enhancement of academic qualifications.

                i. Most activities under the non-formal education programme are supported
                      by development partners. With development partners phasing out support
                      from Bhutan, sustainability would be an issue and a risk.

                ii. Currently the rate of attrition of NFE Instructors is quite high which affects
                      the quality of NFE. If NFE instructors cannot be retained, it will jeopardize
                      the programme.

                iii. Similarly there is also the risk of being unable to retain trained CE tutors on
                      which the efficacy of the CE depends.

                The illiterate population, in-service personnel, out of school youths, neo-literates
                and the wider community.

Justification:  Economic development of a nation depends on young and productive people.
                They represent hopes and future aspirations of the country. In Bhutan, youth
Strategy:       account for about 35% of our population and constitute a unique group with a
                positive force and enormous potential to contribute to development. Recognizing
Risk Assess-    their important role in society, numerous programmes and initiatives are in place
ment:           to improve the well-being of youth.
Beneficiary:    Young people today face numerous challenges as a result of the rapid pace of
                development in the last few decades. This underscores the importance of
                complementing academic programmes with commensurate interventions to
                equip our youth with knowledge and skills so that they are able to cope with
                challenges they are presented with, and fulfill their roles as future custodians
                of the country. In view of this, youth development will be pursued as a priority
                programme in the 11th Plan.

                 i. Youth development needs is a cross cutting theme, which requires concerted
                      and coordinated effort amongst many stakeholders. The implementation
                      of a National Youth Action Plan, which has been developed through wide
                      stakeholder consultation, will be an important strategy.

                 ii. Address youth issues in urban centers and dzongkhags with a sizeable youth
                      population through provision of youth friendly integrated services and
                      facilities.

                 iii. Provide resources and opportunities to youth for holistic development
                      through career education, vocational education, cultural, spiritual programs,
                      scouting and life skills programs.

                 iv. Strengthen parenting education to help them provide the necessary support
                      and guidance to their children and wards in this fast changing world.

                  i. Donor supported projects run the risk of sustainability as donor phase out
                      their support.

                  ii. Adequate resources may not be available which will affect the implementa-
                      tion of the activities.

                  iii.Adequate human resources may not be available which in turn will affect the
                      delivery of activities.

                Eleventh Five Year Plan - Programme Profile - Volume II

Au Name: MINISTRY OF EDUCATION          Department: SECRETARIAT
Program Name: Teacher Support Services  Phase: Approved

Justification:  In all our past Five Year Plans, tremendous amount of capital investments have
                been made in expanding access to education. This is corroborated by the fast
Strategy:       growth rates of Net enrollment rates for primary and secondary education which
                are currently; Primary Net Enrolment Ratio at 96%, Adjusted Net Enrolment Ratio
Risk            at 98% and Basic Net Enrolment Ratio at 94%.
Assessment:     One of the primary issues faced by the education sector is improving the quality
Beneficiary:    of education while simultaneously striving to increase enrolment. There is a
                perception that quality has not kept pace with the expansion of the education
                system and that there is a need to improve the quality of education. With
                teachers being the backbone of the education system, the quality of education
                hinges on the quality of teachers. Hence, there is a need to address the issue of
                teacher shortages and professionalize the teaching profession.
                 i. To professionalize the teaching profession, the INSET Master plan which

                     aims to ensure that all teachers acquire the minimum standard professional
                     development, will be implemented.
                 ii. A Professional Development Division will be set up to solely focus and
                     successfully implement the plans to professionalize the teaching profession.
                 iii.To address the shortage of teachers and unattractiveness of the profession,
                     better living conditions, decent working environment and attractive pay/
                     allowances will be provided
                 iv.HR management of teachers to allow fairness and transparency in decision
                     making will be strengthened. Furthermore, the Teachers' HR policy which
                     among other things looks at institutionalization of career pathways and
                     performance management will be implemented.
                i. Inadequate financial resources will jeopardize the implementation of INSET,
                     HRD activities.
                ii. Inadequate HR both managerial and technical will affect implementation of
                     this programme.
                iii. Other departments and divisions of the Ministry and other relevant
                     stakeholders may not prioritize the implementation of this programme

Au Name: MINISTRY OF EDUCATION           Department: SECRETARIAT
Program Name: Institutional Development  Phase: Approved

Justification:  The various offices under the Secretariat, which include Policy and Planning
                Division, Human Resource Division, Administration and Finance Division,
                Internal Audit Division, Information and Communication Division, and National
                Commission for UNESCO, provide the Secretariat support services to the technical
                departments. Specifically, they provide services such as Five and Annual plan
                formulation, resource mobilization, monitoring, co-ordination and evaluation,
                providing administrative and procurement services, performing HR functions,
                ensuring compliance with rules and regulations, etc.

Strategy:       Currently, the Ministry faces severe crunch in terms of office space, with many
                departments and divisions working out of semi-permanent structures and rented
Risk            spaces. This has not been conducive to service delivery, effective co-ordination
Assessment:     and resource sharing within the Ministry.
Beneficiary:
                i. Construct Secretariat building to ease space crunch, promote efficient service
                    delivery and co-ordination amongst the various departments, divisions of
                    the Ministry.

                ii. Finalize and implement the National Education Policy.
                iii.Strengthen and streamline HR Development and management systems for

                    the large numbers of personnel under the Ministry.
                iv.Use IT to strengthen education management information and inventory

                    systems for greater efficiency and cost effectiveness.
                v. Strengthen monitoring and implementation of plans, policies and programmes

                i. Risk of land for construction of Secretariat building being insufficient due to the
                   current land issue with Dzongkha Development Commission.

                ii. Inadequate manpower and technical capacity in the Ministry, which will affect
                   implementation of plans.

                iii.Timely adequate financial resources not being provided which will jeopardize
                   the implementation of plans.

Au Name: ROYAL UNIVERSITY OF BHUTAN Department: SECRETARIAT

Program Name: Enhancing Access to  Phase: Approved
Tertiary Education (in RUB)

Justification:  Most countries which consider themselves as knowledge-based society are
                characterized by very high GER over 60 to 70 % of the age cohort between 19
Strategy:       and 23 years of age. However, the GER in Bhutan is only around 18%. The target
Risk            in the 11th plan is to increase to 35%, of which RUB aims to contribute 15%. This
Assessment:     translates to increase in total intake capacity of 14000 by 2018 in the 8 member
Beneficiary:    colleges. It is learned that increasing access to tertiary education increases
                employment opportunities, reduce poverty, develop social capital, reduce crime
                and health risk, and boost democratic culture and improve overall quality of life.
                Currently there are around 9000 students with total academic faculties of 490, and
                non-academic staff of 286. In order to ensure accommodation of 14,000 students
                by 2018, there is a need to increase the number of staff and expand infrastructure
                and facilities such as laboratories, libraries, sports facilities, classrooms, hostels
                and staff quarters.
                Further, as envisioned in vision 2020, the university is expected to enhance
                continuing education programmes. This provision will enhance access to tertiary
                education for those who would not have the opportunity to undergo higher
                studies through the regular full-time mode of study.
                i. RUB will consolidate and enhance complementary infrastructures to

                     accommodate at least 1000 to 1500 regular students in each of their
                     member colleges. Additional faculty and administrative staff will be recruited
                     to support the expansion plan. Infrastructure and facilities especially ICT will
                     be strengthened to suit the need of continuing education programmes to
                     enable diversified groups of students to access higher education and training
                     programs.
                ii. RUB will also embrace more private colleges as affiliated colleges of the Royal
                     University of Bhutan to allow private sectors to complement government
                     efforts in expanding access to tertiary education. PPP will also be explored as
                     an option to develop residential facilities.
                Inadequate funding might hamper the expansion of the proposed infrastructure
                and related facilities. The students' accommodations which are planned under
                PPP modality are subject to the availability of private partners, which is not
                certain.

                Students who are able to access the undergraduate and post graduate programs
                are the direct beneficiaries. Indirectly, the society at large will benefit as RUB will
                be producing the critical mass of the educated society in the country.

Au Name: ROYAL UNIVERSITY OF BHUTAN Department: SECRETARIAT

Program Name: Enhancing Quality and  Phase: Approved
Relevance of Tertiary Education

Justification:  Enhancing the quality of teaching and learning has been a crucial factor for
Strategy:       ensuring employability. The RUB has to enhance the quality of teaching and
                learning in order to ensure that the graduates are not only employable within the
                country but are also readily absorbed in the international job market. RUB is also
                required to graduate students who would not only look for jobs but create jobs
                as entrepreneurs since the private sector is still very small and employers in the
                current job market is limited.
                Also due to changing technology and emergence of new knowledge in the market,
                university is expected to diversify programs for the up keep of the relevance of
                the knowledge and skills that are required in the job market. Therefore a number
                of new programmes both at undergraduate and post graduate levels need to be
                introduced.
                RUB believes that achieving qualifications and securing `employment' alone is
                not sufficient to measure the quality of its graduates. The quality of its graduates
                should also include high level of personal development with mindset and behavior
                that demonstrates qualities such as conscientiousness, compassion, loving
                care, respect for others and sense of responsibility to the society. Therefore,
                development of GNH inspired education that embraces personal development
                studies will be a critical aspect of quality of education in the RUB.

                To ensure quality of teaching and learning in the colleges, RUB will further
                strengthen the quality assurance system. Infrastructure and facilities will be
                upgraded including ICT and libraries to support the changing needs and quality
                of the academic programmes. Quality of faculty will be ensured with rigorous
                implementation of human resource development plan and with introduction of
                initiatives that boost staff motivation.
                RUB will also connect students to the world of works, creating opportunities for
                students to take up field based skills such as vocational programmes, internship,
                on-the-job training and other related activities. Students' services will also be
                enhanced to promote environment that is conducive to quality teaching-learning.
                The existing Entrepreneurship Cells will be further developed so that they become
                vibrant and dynamic centers for aspiring entrepreneurs with exciting ideas and
                incubation of businesses.
                A GNH values & holistic education modules and critical pedagogy & contemplative
                education modules will be instituted across the colleges as a foundation of all
                programmes. Such an approach is expected to make learning more consistent
                with GNH values and principles. Spiritual development activities, mindfulness
                practices, community services and related activities will be encouraged and
                supported all across colleges for personal growth and development, and to
                inculcate sense of responsibility to the society and the environment. Ideas and
                activities leading to the development of green campuses will be promoted.

                                                             226

Risk          Due to limited number of qualified and competent people in the market, RUB
Assessment:   may not be able to get adequate pool of people for the development and
Beneficiary:  delivery of programmes as per the plan. Therefore, this might risk the delivery
              of programmes as per the plan, unless RUB works out a dynamic HR strategy to
              address staff shortage.
              Students and faculties of the member colleges will be benefited directly. However
              with improvement in quality of teaching and learning, nation as a whole will
              benefit as RUB will be producing a critical mass of educated citizens, which is key
              to economic growth of the country.

Au Name: ROYAL UNIVERSITY OF BHUTAN               Department: SECRETARIAT
Program Name: Promoting Research, Innovation and  Phase: Approved
Enterprise

Justification:  Research and development is one of the core functions of the University. The
                Royal Charter mandates the RUB to promote and conduct research, and to
Strategy:       contribute to the creation of knowledge of relevance to Bhutan. As mandated
                and to emphasize the crucial role of research, the Department of Research was
Risk            established in 2005 and was entrusted with the task of promoting research in the
Assessment:     university.
Beneficiary:    However, the department is faced with many challenges including developing
                research capacity, creating an enabling research environment, enhancing
                academic knowledge of publication and lack of access to financial support.
                In view of these RUB plans to promote research and development in the 11th plan
                and endeavors to develop itself as a `think-tank' to meaningfully contribute to
                the academic engagement, scholarship, technological innovation in government
                agencies and industry. It also includes academic support in the formulation of
                policies and other decision making processes. RUB will also offer research based
                masters and PhD programs to help build research capacities in the country.
                To promote research, innovation and development, RUB will adopt some of the
                following key strategies:
                - Consolidate structures and institutions to meaningfully engage the university

                     with the economy, government and the larger society.
                - Enhance the culture of research by encouraging incorporation of research and

                     inquiry in the undergraduate programmes where possible and introducing
                     postgraduate studies through research leading to PhD.
                - Build research capacity by enhancing number of faculty with PhDs to 25% by
                     the end of 11th plan.
                - To encourage research, faculties will be engaged in research by reducing
                     4% of the teaching workload, engage in collaboration with other research
                     institutes, organize workshops, seminars, international conferences.
                - Diversify sources of income such as endowment, gifts, donations, short-
                     courses, research, consultancy services and rents to ensure financial
                     sustainability of the university.
                - Integrate research achievement in the performance evaluation.
                The shortage of faculties in the university may limit faculty to take up research
                works. Moreover, if the proposed research grant does not come through, the
                research works may not take off as RUB on its own does not have any research
                fund to support research and innovation in the university.
                The promotion of research and innovation will benefit students, faculties,
                industries, government and society at large.

                                                                           231

and Enterprise in Education

Justification:  Education plays a crucial role in building a productive work force, reducing
Strategy:       poverty and ultimately in improving the prospects for the emergence of a
                knowledge-based society in Bhutan. REC will continue to strengthen its research
Risk            capacity through instituting a culture of research and research-based approaches
Assessment:     to planning and policy development. It will also conduct credible research and
Beneficiary:    publish both at national and international levels and develop into a pioneering
                autonomous educational research organization in Bhutan.
                Through its research activities, it will develop new approaches to education,
                educational policies and programs/curriculum which are strongly grounded on
                evidence, to enhance innovation, creativity and enterprise in education. Their
                research will translate into pilot projects in SEED schools before recommendations
                will be made for adoption into the mainstream education system.

                i. Collaborate and seek support from relevant stakeholders, such as the Ministry
                     of Education, the Royal University of Bhutan and others in implementing its
                     recommendations.

                ii. Research and pilot innovative educational approaches and related programs
                     in educational institutions, including schools and colleges.

                iii. Develop effective mechanism to implement, monitor, and support its
                     programs.

                iv. Share responsibilities in supporting relevant agencies especially their pilot
                     agencies with technical backstopping and guidance.

                v. Monitor and initiate timely evaluation of its activities through quarterly and
                     annual reports to the REC Council and GNHC.

                i. REC as a research think-tank must rely on its key stakeholders, such as the
                     Ministry of Education, Royal

                ii. University of Bhutan, Colleges and schools etc. to access information and
                     carry out research activities. It is not an implementing agency therefore, its
                     achievements and impact depend on the relevant stakeholder's input

                iii. Limited human resource capacity within REC may hamper in realization of its
                     vision, mission and mandates.

Justification:  The Royal Institute of Management was established in 1986 and was incorporated
                as an autonomous institute in 1990 under the Royal Charter with a Board of
Strategy:       Directors as its governing authority. It is mandated to impart, promote and improve

Beneficiary:    centre of excellence in management development to produce socially and
                professionally responsible, proactive leaders and managers.
                During the 11th plan, RIM will be expanding its training programmes including the
                post graduate diploma, masters and management development programs to meet
                the needs of the civil service, corporate, private and civil society organization. A
                total of around 15000 personnel will be trained through regular and in-service
                management development programs with an annual turnover of almost 3000
                personnel against existing annual turnover of 500-600 personnel. The pre-service
                programs are designed to impart managerial skills and facilitate employability of
                graduates and the in-service programs are expected to upgrade the professional
                skills of managers/leaders across all organization including corporations and
                non-governmental organizations. The expansion of programs further demands
                expansion of infrastructure facilities and faculties.
                To ensure institutionalization and delivery of masters program, RIM will continue
                to work with the University of Canberra, Australia, under the RGoB and AusAID
                support. RIM will establish institutional linkages with other renowned institutes/
                universities and explore volunteer professors to address faculty shortages.
                RIM will closely work with RCSC to design and deliver MDP programs at all levels
                of the civil service and with the concerned agencies on the customized training
                courses like procurement management, ethics and integrity, local governance,
                etc.
                Research and development will be promoted to enhance quality of teaching and
                sustainability of the RIM.
                The delivery of newly developed masters program and proposed MDP program
                will depend on the availability of funding support from the government and
                development partners such as AusAID. Further, it also depends on the availability
                of qualified faculties and the ability to retain and motivate those faculties to
                deliver the proposed programs.
                At large the students who have completed class-XII, graduates and in-service
                personnel who avail the diploma, masters program will be the direct beneficiaries.
                The in-service MDP programs are expected to upgrade the professional skills of
                managers/leaders across all organizations and facilitate good governance and
                better public service delivery.

Au Name: MINISTRY OF HEALTH     Department: DEPARTMENT OF MEDICAL SERVICES
Program Name: Medical Services  Phase: Approved

Justification:  The overarching goal of the `Medical Services' is to deliver quality medical
                services and increase access to all citizens of the country. In terms of health
Strategy:       indicators, Bhutan has made great improvements in most parameters related to
                the achievement of MDGs.
Risk            Today, Bhutan is at a juncture of epidemiological transition marked by an increase
Assessment:     in the burden of non-communicable and lifestyle diseases such as hypertension,
Beneficiary:    diabetes while it still has the task of tackling communicable diseases like TB,
                malaria. In addition there has also been major demographic shifts bringing with
                it emerging issues of adolescent health and aging health issues. We have also
                witnessed several manmade and natural disasters in the recent years which has
                claimed lives and damaged properties.
                Health services has to be made accessible for the unreached population, which
                includes nomadic, migratory and peri-urban communities. In terms of service
                delivery, the general perception is that it needs to be improved and made more
                efficient. Furthermore, there is increasing pressure for efficient delivery of
                services and higher service standards.

                   i. Standardization of health services across all health institutions.
                   ii. Improve access to healthcare services by reaching the unreached

                          population through mobile camps, ORCs, construction of sub-post and
                          other innovative approaches
                  iii. Explore feasibility of granting autonomy to JDWNRH and Regional
                          Referral Hospitals
                  iv. Enhance preparedness and response to emergencies and disasters in the
                          Health Facilities and provide access to emergency services by creating
                          EMS Division, improving HHC, establishing trauma centers, EMoNC,
                          essential surgical services, and High Altitude Medicine Program
                   v. Improve access and delivery of services by establishing CT scan &
                          endoscopy facilities in the two regional hospitals and by using ICT
                          enabled health care solutions such as telemedicine
                  vi. Strengthen nursing care services by creating Nursing Division
                   i. Non- availability of financial resources will jeopardize the implementation
                          of the plans.
                   ii. Lack of HR capacity will affect timely implementation of the plans.
                  iii. There is the possibility that inter-sectoral collaboration/community
                          partnership may not be forthcoming

Program Name: Traditional Medical  Phase: Approved
Services

Justification:  The Ministry of Health envisages integration of traditional medicine with the
Strategy:       modern health care system with nation's rich bio-diversity and proven medical
                qualities of plants. The maintenance of traditional medicine not only adds di-
Risk            mensions to the nation's system of health care, but also provides an alternative
Assessment:     choice of health care service. It should also be regarded as a conscious decision
Beneficiary:    to conserve a part of our rich and varied cultural heritage.

                Recognizing the importance of expansion coverage of traditional medicine ser-
                vices to unreached rural populations to curb morbidity statistics in the country,
                traditional medicine services planning capacity will be strengthened. To reduce
                underutilization in some locations, streamlining traditional medicine service
                through development of standard operating procedures will be pursued.

                i. Strengthen the traditional medicine services by up-gradation of TM Division
                     to Department of TM, and expanding services, wherever necessary,

                ii. Optimize operation and improve efficiency by corporatizing MSP and
                     commercializing its products;

                iii. A Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) compliant facility to be established to
                     ensure production of quality and safe medicines that addresses the demand
                     for it.

                iv. Strengthen the production of Herbal health products and introduce new
                     products to encourage business entities institute SPA therapies and wellness
                     centers.

                v. Collaborate with relevant stakeholders to promote sustainable sourcing
                     of raw materials by establishing medicinal herb gardens and promote
                     domestication of rare and endangered species of medicinal plants.

                vi. Strengthen research capacity to promote evidence based treatments and
                     services and facilitate integration of TM with allopathic medicine

                 i. Demand for traditional medicine services may not be met if GMP is not
                     constructed.

                ii. If sufficient and qualified personnel are not available, integration of TM
                     with modern medicine as well as development of new products will be
                     affected.

                iii. Unavailability of Inadequate financial resources will affect implementation
                     of plans.

                Patients, general public and business firms engaged with wellness centers.

Program Name: Medicines, Technologies  Phase: Approved
and Logistics

Justification:   The efficient and effective delivery of health services depends on steady and
                adequate stock of medical supplies like medicines equipment and machines.
Strategy:       However, the health sector continues to face the insufficient of stock of essential
                medicines, irrational use of essential medicines, inappropriate/under utilization
Risk            of high-end health technologies, and sometimes-irrational introduction of Health
Assessment:     technologies.
Beneficiary:    The main reason for these gaps is due to a clear strategy/guidelines that ensures
                proper planning and co-ordination among the relevant Departments/Divisions
                and Units within the Ministry. These factors can contribute to lack of access to,
                or inappropriate utilization and inefficient utilization of essential medical services
                and products, and waste of financial resources.

                 i. Strengthening procurement system for essential drugs to ensure timely and
                      adequate supplies. This includes developing an ICT based indenting and
                      store management system.

                 ii. Strengthening monitoring and evaluation on utilization of medicines and
                      technologies to address the issues of irrational and inappropriate use of
                      medicines and technologies.

                iii. Enhance evidence and value-based decisions in assessing the technologies
                      to ensure selection of useful and cost effective technologies. This includes
                      investment in building HR capacities in essential medicines and technologies.

                iv. Strengthening the system for maintenance for specialized medical equipment
                      to allow for their efficient and effective functioning.

                 i. If adequate and skilled personnel are not available, it will affect the selection
                      and maintenance of specialized medical equipment.

                 ii. Dependency on suppliers and vendors and 100% advance payment which
                      delays in availability of spare parts, hence delays repair and service of
                      equipments.

Au Name: MINISTRY OF HEALTH  Department: SECRETARIAT

Program Name: Institutional Strengthening & Monitoring Phase: Approved

Justification:  The various offices under the Secretariat, which include Policy and Planning
Strategy:       Division, Human Resource Division, Administration and Finance Division, Internal
                Audit Division and Bhutan Health Trust Fund provide the Secretariat support
                services to the technical departments. Specifically, they provide services such
                as Five and Annual plan formulation, resource mobilization, monitoring, co-
                ordination and evaluation, providing administrative and procurement services,
                performing HR functions, ensuring compliance with rules and regulations, etc.
                Amongst them, the Human Resource Division is one of the critical divisions which
                has to address the issues of i) the shortages of medical and technical professionals
                in specific categories, ii) Limited specialized skills of the health care providers and
                iii) low motivation of the health care providers.
                Health planning and monitoring and evaluation capacity at central and local
                government level (including analysis and use of health information has to be
                strengthened. The capacities to conduct health economic policy research and
                analysis are very limited and needs to be enhanced. This is important given the
                future sustainability issues of health services.
                Quality of services needs to be enhanced through standardization of services,
                monitoring and regulation of health professionals and practices. To allow
                for greater effectiveness of health services, inter-sectoral collaboration and
                community partnership with private sector and NGOs needs to be developed.

                 i. Strengthen HR management and coordination to increase skills and number
                      of health professionals.

                 ii. Strengthen health planning and monitoring through using results based
                      planning approach and developing a robust Health Information System.

                iii. Strengthen the legal and regulatory framework for Health sector through
                      enactment of Health Act.

                iv. Improve sustainability of health care financing through exploring alternative
                      options such as introduction of billing system and charging of non- Bhutanese
                      and improving off-hour clinic.

                 v. Developing capacity and systems for health research to allow for better
                      preparedness and targeting of vulnerable groups, areas and periods.

                vi. Expanding ICT-enabled health care services such as telemedicine, video
                      consultations etc.

                vii. Institute Continuous Quality Improvement (CQI) in health facilities.
                viii. Strengthening of the BMHC and BHTF Secretariats to improve regulatory and

                      financing functions.

                                                                        262

Risks          i. If adequate human resource are not provided, it will affect the implementation
Beneficiary:       of plans.

              ii. Due rapid change in health system and advancement in medical technologies,
                   it is costly to procure and maintain them. If adequate resources are not made
                   available, it will jeopardize the implementation of plans.

              iii. Health cuts across sectors and depends on the co-ordination and co-
                   operation from other stakeholders. If this is not forthcoming, it will affect
                   the plans.

Au Name: MINISTRY OF HEALTH           Department: DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH
Program Name: Public Health Services  Phase: Draft

Justification:  The socio-economic development of a country depends on the productivity and
Strategy:       well being of its citizens which in turn, amongst many other things, also depends
                on their state of health. In terms of health indicators, Bhutan has made great
                improvements in most parameters related to the achievement of MDGs.
                Today, Bhutan is at a juncture of epidemiological transition marked by an
                increase in the burden of non-communicable diseases while it still has the task of
                tackling communicable diseases like TB, malaria, coupled with emerging and re-
                emerging diseases due to climate change. Sedentary lifestyles with traditionally
                high fat based diets coupled with consumption of tobacco and alcohol has lead
                to increasing rate of diabetes, hypertension, cancers etc. The cost of treating
                NCDs is very expensive and hence there is a need to intensify our efforts on
                health promotion to prevent the onset of these diseases and manage them
                better for reduced morbidity. Similarly, efforts towards preventive actions for
                communicable disease must continue to ensure better health for our citizens.
                 i. Strengthen capacity for event based surveillance (EBS) and indicator based

                      surveillance towards all hazard approach and establish link with other
                      sectors for risk assessment and response to public health events.
                 ii. Develop and implement an integrated national strategy for sanitation and
                      hygiene.
                iii. Operationalize PHL to improve efficiency and effectiveness of laboratory
                      based disease surveillance, response system, to act as national reference
                      laboratory for quality assessment of water; food and drug testing; and other
                      special testing services.
                iv. Develop and strengthen National Initiative for improving nutrition and
                      micro-nutrient deficiencies.
                 v. Advocate for Health in all Policies for ensuring mainstreaming of health
                      concerns in the planning and implementation of all sectors' programmes.
                vi. Integrate management of Neonatal and Childhood illness with MCH, CDD,
                      ARI and nutrition programmes to improve health of mother and child.
                vii. Scale up and intensify implementation, management and monitoring of key
                      programmes of HIV and TB
                viii. Implement Health Strategies for vulnerable groups of youth, differently
                      abled and elderly persons.
                ix. Integrate prevention and advocacy of NCDs with PHC???
                 x. Strengthen outreach of health services through urban and village health
                      workers and maintenance of current vaccines and expansion of new
                      vaccines.

Risk          Possible Risks are:
Assessment:    i. Lacks of Funds- Most of the Public Health Programs are donor funded.
Beneficiary:
                    Phasing out of donors is seen as a possible risk which might hamper the
                    implementation of the plan and achieving the targets as set.
               ii. Turnover of key technical staff and lack of adequate trained HR may affect
                    the implementation of the plan.
              iii. Responsibility of improving health status is spread beyond health sector.
                    Inter-sectoral/multi-sectoral collaboration and community participation is
                    required in furthering the cause of health promotion and effectiveness of
                    its strategies. If this is not forthcoming, it will jeopardize the plan.
              Vulnerable groups, patients, mothers, children and community.

                schemes, disability insurance and insurance for employees with disability and
                redundant employees. Foreign workers fee system will be introduced to regulate
                and streamline recruitment of foreign workers in the country.
                i. Enforcement of Labour and Employment Act and its regulations through

                     awareness and advocacy, development of guidelines and procedures and
                     periodic labour inspection services.
                ii. Instituting a Social Protection System by developing national social protection
                     policy and reviewing of the national minimum wage and introducing
                     retirement benefits and other social security schemes for the national work
                     force.

                     workers recruitment procedures and introducing foreign workers fee system.

                     effectively deliver the services related to labour administration.
                i. Labour market is dependent on the economic direction of the country which
                     in turn decides overall need of workers in the country???.
                ii. Manpower and budget constraint in implementing the programme could be
                     a potential risk.
                iii. There could be also lack of cooperation from employers and employees in
                     implementing and improving the policies and regulations.
                Employees, foreign workers, employers in the public and private sector.

Justification:  Quality of skilled workers is essential for the growth and productivity of the
                economy. The quality of workers has to be enhanced through appropriate skills
Strategy:       training in the technical institutes, where training standards meet the expectations
                of the labour market demand as well registration and accreditation standards.
Risk            This programme aims to improve the quality, relevance and competitiveness of
Assessment:     TVET graduates and skilled workers in the country in line with industry requirement.
Beneficiary:    To achieve these outcomes, the Bhutan Vocational Qualifications Framework and
                Quality Assurance System must be implemented. The skill needs of the industries
                will be captured through the development of National Competency Standards
                based on which the TVET training programmes will aligned and strengthened,
                thereby enhancing the quality and relevance of TVET delivery.
                i. The BVQF will be implemented in close consultation and involvement

                     of relevant stakeholders. Similarly, National Competency Standards and
                     Assessment Resources will be developed and Competency Based Assessments
                     conducted in line with the BVQF by involving field experts from the industries
                     and training providers.
                ii. The QAS will be strengthened to ensure that TVET providers meets the quality
                     standards required to deliver quality TVET programmes. All the training
                     providers will be registered, monitored and graded based on compliance to
                     the Registration Regulation 2010. Accreditation of training programmes will
                     be implemented to ensure that the training programmes meet the standards
                     set in the Accreditation guidelines. The accredited TVET programmes will be
                     eligible for the National Certification.
                i. Lack of active participation of stakeholders will impact the overall
                     implementation of BVQF and QAS
                ii. Lack of budgetary and human resources especially in the TVET institutes will

Justification:  The shortage of skilled and qualified human resources is a continuing challenge
Strategy:       the country faces. Investments in building and strengthening necessary human
Risk            capital at various levels across sectors are crucial. The National HRD policy has
Assessment:     been developed with the objective to align the overall HRD plans and policies
Beneficiary:    of different sectors. Similarly, national HRD road map is expected to guide the
                overall development of human resources in the country in consistent with the
                economic growth and long-term development goals. This in turn is expected
                to steer socio-economic development plans and programs and enhance overall
                productivity in the economy.
                Although the private and corporate sector is considered an engine of socio-
                economic development, the private sector in particular is constrained with
                qualified and adequate manpower. This program will continue to implement need
                based HRD programs and services that will generate growth and employment in
                the sector. Furthermore, this program will support the private sector in carrying
                out its own HRD planning and implementation.
                i. Strengthen the management of HRD portfolio for improved planning,

                     coordinating, implementing and monitoring of the National HRD Policy and
                     master plan.
                ii. Developing and implementing the national HRD master plan in particular for
                     the private and corporate sector. This will provide the strategic overview and
                     coherence in planning and implementing HRD. Furthermore, the Master plan
                     will be continuously monitored and reviewed to ensure that the activities are
                     relevant to changing socio-economic scenarios.
                iii. Publishing national HRD advisory series on periodic basis to guide and
                     streamline overall HR planning, investment and development for the short
                     and medium term.
                iv. Continue to diversify and strengthen the TVET training programs to provide
                     relevant vocational and technical skills and knowledge to youth entering the
                     job market.
                i. Inadequate human resources being provided to the Department to implement
                     the National HRD Policy. This will greatly affect the efficacy of its plans.
                ii. Inadequate financial resources being provided for timely and effective
                     implementation.
                iii. Lack of support from HRD implementing agencies, especially the private
                     sector to invest in HR for their staff.
                iv. The development of the comprehensive and coherent HRD master plan can
                     be jeopardized if the co-operation of key stakeholders in the HR sector is not
                     forthcoming.
                v. Similarly, there is also the risk that potential trainees may not be willing to
                     participate in the trainings.

Au Name: DRATSANG LHENTSHOG               Department: NA
Program Name: Strengthening of Dratshang  Phase: Approved

Justification:  The objective of the Dratsang is to strengthen spiritual education system from
                primary till tertiary level in the country. This is to establish a strong foundation
Strategy:       grounded on Buddhist values and spiritual practices of our age-old tradition. The
Risk            construction of Tango Buddhist college was also initiated in the 10th plan primarily
Assessment:     to facilitate access to higher Buddhist studies in the country. There are monastic
Beneficiary:    institutions established across the country both at primary and secondary level,
                but an institution where access to higher level spiritual education was limited.
                Currently, there are around 4500 students enrolled in monastic institutions that
                are established across the country. The target is to increase to 5500 students by
                the end of 11th plan. Monastic institutions are increasingly becoming a primary
                avenue for the children from the socially and economically disadvantaged
                groups to access education. In view of this, it is proposed to strengthen monastic
                institutions to promote Buddhist studies and also facilitate the development
                of tsamkhangs and meditation centers for the elderly people to continue their
                spiritual practices and pursuits.
                i. Improve the academic and hostel facilities of dratsangs, rabdeys, shedras,

                     gomdeys and other monastic institutions which currently have very limited
                     facilities.
                ii. At the primary education level, improve the nutrition and sanitation in the
                     monastic institutes through financial support.
                iii. Upgrade existing monastic institutions to accommodate the students
                     graduating from the primary level to improve access to secondary and higher
                     level of Buddhist studies.
                i. Inadequate financial resources will jeopardize the implementation of plan
                     activities.
                ii. Inadequate HR both managerial and technical may affect implementation of
                     the programme.

Program Name: Preservation and Promotion
of Culture.

Justification:  Preservation and promotion of Bhutan's cultural heritage has always been
                accorded a high priority on the development agenda and the relevance of culture
Strategy:       to development outcomes cannot be underestimated. It is deemed vital for the
Risk            country's survival and socio-economic progress as it provides a strong basis for
Assessment:     building national identity and unity. Bhutanese tradition and culture also plays a
Beneficiary:    vital role in protecting and conserving the country's rich natural environment. It
                stands as a material and spiritual representation of aspirations, achievements,
                expressions and expertise of renowned spiritual and historical figures over
                centuries.
                The mounting pressure from the forces of globalization has put considerable
                strain on conservation and promotion efforts.
                The Department of Culture under the Ministry of Home and Cultural Affairs
                continuously strives to preserve and promote Bhutan's rich and unique cultural
                heritage. The long-term objective of the department is to integrate holistically
                the preservation, promotion and development of the cultural heritage of Bhutan
                into all areas of sustainable development.
                i. Inventorying, classification and documentation of tangible cultural heritage.
                ii. Preservation and promotion of cultural properties and heritage sites.
                iii. Strengthen institutions responsible for preservation, conservation and

                     promotion of cultural heritage.
                iv. Development of a strategic cross-cutting plan for preservation and promotion

                     of our cultural heritage.
                i. The risk foreseen while implementing the planned activities would be the

                     availability of adequate fund and its timely release.
                ii. It may also be highlighted that inadequate human resources in general and

                     the lack of skilled professionals in the field of conservation in particular might
                     also hamper proper and timely execution of the planned activities.
                All sections of the society, artisans, linguistic, tourism sector, religious institutions/
                organizations and minor communities will benefit from this programme.

Landscapes and Conservation of Biodiversity

Justification:  With increasing pace for developmental activities across the country, the natural
                resources are placed under severe pressure. Prioritized developmental activities
Strategy:       are takes place increasingly inside the protected areas and critical watersheds.
                Such pressures, if left unchecked will pose grave threat to the biodiversity
Risk            resources and will ultimately affect the functioning of the natural system.
Assessment:     As a country which displayed excellent track record in the area of environment
Beneficiary:    conservation, nature conservation will continue to be an integral aspect of the
                Bhutan's development. The management of parks and protected areas which
                consists of about 51.44% of the total land area would be a major challenge at
                a time when the country is undergoing rapid economic growth. This program
                will focus on maintaining a healthy balance between meeting the development
                needs of the people without undermining or damaging the natural environment.
                i. The program is strictly designed in-line with the National Forest Policy of

                     2011. The focus on the program will be on promoting sustainable utilization
                     of the protected area resources for the benefit of the resident communities
                     based on functional zones.
                ii. Designated core zones of the protected areas will be strictly protected for
                     biodiversity conservation purposes.
                iii. Innovative interventions based on scientific research will be designed to
                     secure the integrity of the parks and the biological corridors.
                iv. As a means of linking environmental conservation to development,
                     ecotourism activities will be strongly pursued in the protected areas in close
                     collaboration with the Tourism Council.
                v. Additionally, the program will, aside from promoting sustainable use of
                     forest resources including NWFPs, design effective interventions to mitigate
                     human wildlife conflict.
                i. Ownership of natural resources by the local communities.
                ii. Adverse impact of climate change on the natural systems.
                iii. Inadequate technical capacity and resources.
                iv. Over emphasis on economic development over conservation.

FORESTS
Program Name: Sustainable Management Phase: Approved
of State Forests

Justification:  The Department of Forest and Park Services has over the years tried to maintain
                a balance between conservation and economic development. The concept of
Strategy:       sustainable forest management plays an important role in maintaining the health
                of the ecosystem and in upholding the constitutional mandate of maintaining
Risk            a minimum of 60% forest covers for all times to come, without compromising
Assessment:     people demand for timer and other forest produce.
Beneficiary:    While Forest Management Units (FMUs) & Working Schemes (WS) cater to the
                demand of timber for domestic and commercial purpose, the community forest
                and Non- wood Forest Produce (NWFP) management groups also help in improving
                the living standards of the rural people through sale of forest produce and non-
                wood forest produce from their managed area. Going forward, the Department
                will continue to work toward promoting the sustainable management and
                utilization of forest and other biodiversity resources for livelihood and economic
                development.
                i. Implementation of all the activities will be carried out in coherence with the

                     National Forest Policy, 2011. The Department will start to implement various
                     strategies, road maps and documents developed in the 10th FYP for carrying
                     out the planned interventions of the program.
                ii. In the interest of ownership and sustainability, the implementation of the
                     activities will be entrusted to the field divisions (Territorial Divisions, Parks,
                     Dzongkhag Forestry Sector) in close collaboration with other relevant
                     stakeholders such as NRDCL.
                iii. Since most of the activities are co-ordinated at the central level, the central
                     agencies will plan and monitor all the activities in the field. Technical
                     backstopping to the field offices will be provided by the functional divisions.
                i. Inadequate skilled human resources
                ii. Timely adequate funding
                iii. Impact of Climate Change
                i. Farmers
                ii. Communities living in town and cities
                iii. Wood based Industries and factories
                iv. International communities

Au Name: MINISTRY OF AGRICULTURE AND FORESTS Department: DEPARTMENT OF FOREST
Program Name: Integrated Watershed Management Phase: Approved
to ensure Sustainable Environmental Services

Justification:  Well managed watersheds play a pivotal role in supplying a wide range of goods
                and services both on-site and downstream. They are the basis for sustainable
Strategy:       agriculture, forestry and pastoral pursuits, sustaining biodiversity and providing
Risk            other environmental benefits as well as water for local and downstream use. The
Assessment:     production of hydro power for export and internal use, contributes about 24% to
Beneficiary:    Bhutan's GDP and this is expected to rise further with the planned construction of
                more hydro plants, making electricity generation the single biggest contributor to
                the economy. Consequently, a reliable supply of quality water is the most valuable
                commercial product derived from watersheds. It is evident that the maintenance
                and improvement of the country's watersheds is a high management priority, not
                only for hydro power, but also for domestic use and irrigation.
                This program will continue to work toward maintaining environmentally and
                economically healthy watersheds.
                i. The program implementation shall pursue a two-pronged approach that will

                     distinguish activities to be carried out on its own at the strategic level, and
                     those activities that must be integrated, incorporated and harmonized into
                     the implementation plans of other area- based development, conservation
                     and management programs within and outside the Ministry. These include
                     the regular development plans of the Dzongkhags and Geogs as well as the
                     land-use specific planning frameworks such as those that apply to FMUs, Pas
                     and CFs.
                ii. The focus will be on identification and assessment of critical watershed and
                     designing watershed specific interventions.
                iii. Identify and inventory the significant wetland of Bhutan and promote its
                     conservation through appropriate interventions.
                i. Environmental protection remains a priority for the Bhutan;
                ii. Bhutanese economy continue to grow and will remain supportive of the
                     sector initiatives by provisioning adequate resources in achieving the 11th
                     FYP targets;
                iii. Integrated Watershed management approach is acceptable to concerned
                     agencies.
                i. Farmers (drinking water and irrigation)
                ii. Residents of town and cities ( drinking water and other uses)
                iii. Factories and industries ( cooling and other purposes)
                iv. International communities
                v. Hydropower companies

Justification:  Bhutan is located in one of the most fragile and vulnerable ecosystem in the
                eastern Himalayas. Increasingly it has witness high frequency and intensity of
Strategy:       disaster due to the effect of climate change, emerging socioeconomic pressure
Risk            and changing demographic patterns. Bhutan also falls under one of the most
Assessment:     seismically active zones (Zone IV and V) in the world. This is evident from the
Beneficiary:    21st September, 2009 and 18th September 2011 earthquakes, which caused
                widespread damages in the country. Further, GLOFs is one the most serious
                potential natural hazard due to the effects of global warming, and rapid glaciers
                retreats in the Himalayas. Bhutan was hit by GLOF in the past in 1957, 1960, and
                1968 and recently in 1994.
                In view of the above, the DDM proposed to strengthen disaster preparedness,
                reduce disaster risk and ensure disaster resilient infrastructure development at
                all levels of the government and community at large.
                i. Continue to create awareness and inculcate a mindset of disaster prevention,

                     mitigation and preparedness in the pre-disaster phase,
                ii. Develop effective disaster response capabilities at various levels for

                     post disaster services. Disaster preparedness and response ability at the
                     community level will be strengthen and accord high priority.
                iii. Efforts to mainstream disaster resilient infrastructure development into the
                     development of policies and plans.
                Though there is strong political commitment from the government, establishment
                of disaster management institutes at various levels of the government agencies
                and Dzongkhags, and preparation of disaster management plan for all 20
                Dzongkhags and relevant agencies would be a daunting task for the DDM in the

Justification:  With the aim to achieve sustainable development in the country, the activities
Strategy:       of the 11 FYP for NEC has been formulated incorporating the urgent needs that
Risk            should be in place to ensure judicious use of natural resources along with policy
Assessment:     and regulatory measures that enable and facilitate this commitment. At present,
                Bhutan has a pristine environment with 70.46 percent forest coverage and 19,751
                square kilometers of land under protected areas and biological corridors but
                growing population, urbanization, infrastructure expansion and industrialization
                among many others, place increasing demand of natural resources along with
                pressure on the state of the environment like air and water quality and land
                pollution. The commitment to remain carbon neutral and maintain forest cover
                of 60% at all times to come has becoming increasingly challenging as we open
                up to meet the new development needs of the country. NEC therefore will
                continue to support towards strengthening and enforcement of legislations and
                policies, advocate environment mainstreaming, promote green development,
                ensure water security, enhance service delivery, thereby ensuring sustainable
                development and minimize negative impact on environment.

                i. In order to ensure minimum negative impact on environment from
                     development activities, continued efforts will be made through strengthening
                     of environmental laws and regulations, policies and plans and national
                     capacity. Mainstreaming of environment in the sectoral policies plans and
                     programmes with support from GNHC will be promoted through awareness
                     and capacity building both at the central and local level.

                ii. Water security will be strengthened through the development of integrated
                     water resource management plan and better coordination. This will be further
                     supported through the enforcement of Water Act and development of water
                     regulation. Further environmental assessment process will be strengthened
                     through establishment of four regional environment offices which also aims
                     to deliver prompt, professional and effective public services.

                i. In order to effectively carry out these activities, some of the risks foreseen
                     are the sector implementation of the legislation, mainly due to the lack of
                     human resources and capacity at all levels. In addition, one of the biggest
                     risks is the availability of resources to carry out these prioritized activities
                     which is linked to the realization of the SKRAs and NKRAs.

                ii. Inadequate budget for TA/DA and fuel might hamper effective compliance
                     monitoring and site visits to the field. This was one of the problems
                     encountered in the 10th plan, which hampered carrying out of other activities
                     as well.

Beneficiary:    Local households and individuals are expected to have built capacity, immense
                benefits from sustainable use of natural resources, enjoy clean air and water and
                ensure water security.
                At the national level, the successful implementation of the plan will help maintain
                pristine environment, maintain green house gas emission within sequestration
                capacity of our forest.

Au Name: BHUTAN OLYMPIC COMMITTEE  Department: SECRETARIAT

Program Name: Excellence through sports for all. Phase: Draft

Justification:  Sports and games directly or indirectly impact the lives of all citizens, irrespective
                of age or gender, and have significant potential to contribute positively to the
Strategy:       national economy, culture, good governance, international relations, community

Assessment:     The current situation of a high proportion of youth population, increasing rural-
Beneficiary:    to-urban migration, increasing urbanization and associated lifestyle-related
                health problems, are challenges of the development process. If not mitigated,
                such problems can have serious repercussion on society's health, value systems,
                living environment and the economy.
                In light of the overwhelming evidence of the benefits of sports and given the
                present systemic weaknesses, there is a compelling need for a focused and
                coherent sports development plan that will strategically intervene.
                i. Establish a robust sport governance system to efficiently deliver organized

                     sports to all.
                ii. Identify and pursue mechanisms to secure the financial sustainability of

                     development programs and accountability within sports bodies
                iii. Develop human resource capacity in sports bodies for delivery of services

                     and results
                iv. Provide opportunities and access to sports facilities by optimizing

                     management and utilization of existing and new sports infrastructure
                v. Promote a vibrant sporting culture and overall sports development through

                     advocacy and engaging all forms of media and communications
                vi. Engage all national and international partners and stakeholders through a

                     clear strategic partnership framework.
                i. Unavailability of land for constructing sports infrastructure
                ii. Lack of sufficient financial resources may affect the efficacy of the plan.
                iii. Human Resource capacity within the Bhutan Olympic Committee and

                     stakeholders is limited and without additional HR, the implementation of the
                     plan will be affected.
                iv. To achieve Sports for all depends on the support of multiple stakeholders.
                     Without their co-operation, the successful implementation of plan is at risk.
                The target population is the public at large, with a special emphasis on the youth.

Au Name: MINISTRY OF FINANCE     Department: DEPARTMENT OF REVENUE &
                                 CUSTOMS

Program Name: Revenue & Customs Services Phase: Approved

Justification:  The Department of Revenue and Customs is primarily responsible for mobilizing
                internal resources through taxes, royalties and non-tax revenues to cover
Strategy:       the expenditures of the RGoB to implement its socio-economic plans and
Risk            programmes. An optimum tax system is one which stimulates equity and fairness,
Assessment:     efficiency, neutrality, simplicity, certainty, flexibility and fiscal adequacy.
Beneficiary:    Evidence suggests that other non-hydro revenue sources are losing ground,
                reflecting the narrow tax base and generous incentives and exemptions. The
                modernization of tax and custom administration will help to increase tax
                collections while simultaneously reducing the cost of collection. One of the key
                initiatives will be simplifying and rationalizing the tax procedures and developing
                a web based revenue administration system to maintain, generate and analyze
                information efficiently for decision making purposes.
                i. Initiate specific fiscal reforms in the 11th plan in customs administration and

                     compliance. Also rationalize and simplify the tax administration to increase
                     collection and enhance compliance.
                ii. Develop a web-based system called Revenue Administration and Management
                     Information System (RAMIS) to allow for greater efficiency in maintaining,
                     analyzing and generating information.
                iii. Facilitate trade activities through supporting Department of Trade in its
                     pursuit of favorable bilateral agreements and appointing necessary trade
                     agents in the entry points.
                iv. Strengthen institutional and manpower capacity.
                i. Parliamentary approval needs to be sought for any fiscal policy change.
                ii. Other external factors influence the collection of taxes from the business
                     enterprises such as the global economic conditions and policies especially
                     monetary policy influences trade, thereby affecting tax collections.
                iii. Inadequate funds and human resources will affect implementation of plans
                     in a timely manner.

Program Name: National Budget Services  BUDGET
                                        Phase: Approved

Justification:  The Department of National Budget has the responsibility of preparing the multi-
                year rolling budgets (MYRB) in accordance to the budget manual. The MYRB
Strategy:       system which started as a pilot in the 9th Plan makes budget projections for more
                than one financial year. Minor system modifications will be carried out to make
Risk            MYRB system more versatile in the 11 FYP through constant revision of formula
Assessment:     used in the preparation of recurrent budget and incorporation of additional
Beneficiary:    reports formats. Furthermore, the integration of MYRB with Public Expenditure
                Management System (PEMS) and Plan Monitoring system (PlaMS) will provide
                all budgeting agencies with holistic view of their plans, annual budgets and
                expenditures.
                As required by the Public Finance Act 2007 and amendment thereof, a multi-
                year rolling budget i.e. two years' expenditure projections will have to be
                implemented in the 11 FYP. The National Budget Services will have to ensure
                efficient and effective allocation and utilization of public resources. This will be
                implemented through strengthened monitoring and co-ordination of the annual
                budgets in collaboration with Department of Public Accounts.
                i. Establish proper linkage between plan and budget ­ integrating MYRB

                     system with Plan monitoring System (PlaMS) of GNHC to allow for greater
                     efficiencies in reporting and decision making.
                ii. Implement multi- year rolling budget from the start of 11 FYP as required by
                     the Public Finance Act 2007 and amendment thereof.
                iii. Provide resource position of the Government so that implementing agencies
                     can plan and re-prioritize with greater certainty about future resource
                     allocations and improve resource allocation to strategic priorities.
                iv. Gender Responsive Budgeting to advance gender equality and women's
                     empowerment.
                v. Green budgeting for conservation of environment and the sustainable use of
                     the natural resources.
                i. Inadequate resources can affect the implementation of activities to develop
                     systems.
                ii. Gender responsive and green budgeting are new concepts and limited
                     expertise being may challenge the implementation of these activities

                                          Phase: Approved

Justification:  The Department of National Property (DNP) manages the extensive moveable
                and immoveable properties owned by RGoB. The DNP also spearheads and
Strategy:       manages procurement system of the Government.
Risk            In order to enhance the efficiency and effectiveness, transparency and
Assessment:     accountability and compliance in the government systems, Department of
Beneficiary:    National Property will improve the planning and procurement system in the
                11th FYP. These initiatives will make the procurement system more competitive,
                transparent and efficient leading to competitive prices for goods & services.
                Furthermore to prevent pilferage, loss of assets and false claims on government
                properties and assets, the property and inventory management system of the
                Government will also be revamped and made into a web based e-inventory
                system.
                The Department will also strengthen the PAVA and compensation systems to
                provide better valuations of both the public and private properties in the country.
                In line with policy of promotion and preservation of our age old traditions and
                culture, the DNP will promote various arts and crafts to cater to the needs of both
                the government and private sector.
                i. Develop and implement proper planning and e-procurement system
                ii. Develop and implement government property management system like

                     e-inventory
                iii. Promote traditional Arts and crafts through diversification of products for

                     use by government agencies.
                iv. Strengthen PAVA and compensation systems
                i. Budget being unavailable at the right time could constrain the implementation

                     of plans.
                ii. Expertise being unavailable to improve PAVA and compensation system

                     could affect the plan.
                iii. Effective Property management of government properties depends on

                     coordination and co-operation with many government agencies. If this is
                     not forthcoming, it can affect effective implementation of the plan.

Au Name: MINISTRY OF FINANCE        Department: SECRETARIAT
Program Name: Secretariat Services  Phase: Approved

Justification:  The Secretariat of Ministry of Finance provides the support services such as
                administration, finance and human resource management for the departments
Strategy:       under the Ministry. Other very specific responsibilities are the monitoring and co-
Risk            ordination of the macro-economic situation, the management of internal audit
Assessment:     for all government agencies, and Corporate Governance of Public Enterprises.
Beneficiary:    The recent rupee shortage has clearly shown that the management of
                macroeconomic situation and forecasting needs to strengthened further.
                Additional sectoral information pertaining to trade, money and banking, tourism,
                State Owned Enterprises (SOE) needs to be added to the current framework
                (MTFF) to make macro-fiscal projections more robust.
                To enhance fiscal and financial accountability and transparency, there is a need
                to strengthen Internal Audit services to improve performance and pre-empt
                corruption right from the initial stages. Further, Corporate Governance needs to
                be strengthened through improved monitoring. This will contribute to increased
                revenue generation for the government.
                i. Strengthen Macroeconomic coordination management through the up-gra-

                     dation of MTTF to Macro-economic Framework (MEF), to provide reliable
                     information and data for policy and decision makers. The MEF will be un-
                     derpinned by an IT system to allow for greater efficiency and effectiveness.
                ii. Strengthen Fiscal and Financial accountability and transparency through re-
                     viewing and augmenting the structures and responsibilities of Internal Audit
                     Units in Government.
                iii. Improved analysis and review of performance of State Owned Enterprises
                     through development of an information and performance management sys-
                     tem for SOEs.
                i. The development of various systems depends on co-ordination and coop-
                     eration by stakeholders. Lack of coordination and support by stakeholder
                     agencies which will affect the implementation of plans.
                ii. Limited knowledge and skills to tackle macroeconomic, fiscal and corporate
                     governance issues may affect effective implementation of plans.
                All Government agencies and the economy sector as a whole.

Justification:  The Department of Civil Registration and Census (DCRC) core mandate is to
                deliver the civil registration and census services to the general public in line with
Strategy:       the Citizenship Law of the land. During the 11th plan, in order to improve the
Risk            services, it is proposed to put in place a reliable service delivery system through
Assessment:     the establishment of online Bhutan Civil Registration System (BCRS). To support
Beneficiary:    the online system, ICT network infrastructure and associated equipments will be
                upgraded at the headquarter, dzongkhags, dungkhags and thromdes. Automated
                Fingerprint Information System (AFIS) will also be incorporated in the online
                system to enable efficient verification and authentication of citizen information.
                i. In order to enhance effective and efficient delivery of civil registration and

                     census services, DCRC will create a conducive working environment for the

                iii. Create step by step process for all services
                i. Shortage of manpower and limited technical expertise (manpower) to
                     sustain the online BCRS services
                ii. Inadequate fund
                iii. Lack of effective inter-agency coordination and collaboration are some of
                     the factors that could affect effective implementation of the programme

Beneficiary     and done in the 10th plan, the DLG will continue to build capacity of the LG
                functionaries through series trainings, workshops , seminars and exposure visits
                both within and outside the country. Various studies are also proposed that will
                look into finding solutions to recurring problems in the LGs regarding policy and
                legislations.
                i. Strengthening the capacity of the LG functionaries is viewed as a foundation

                     of efficiency and effective delivery of public services. In view of this, DLG will
                     continue to build capacity of the LG functionaries in collaboration with other
                     relevant stakeholders.
                ii. Emphasis will also be put in to improve information management system,
                     participation of female in the LG functionaries, and improving the
                     coordination mechanism with external stakeholders.
                i. Inadequate financial resources can affect the implementation of activities
                ii. If sufficient human resources are not provided, it will also affect the timely

Rescue Services

Justification:  The Fire Service Department comprises 2 officers and 165 police personnel who
                cater fire fighting and emergency fire services across the nation. Besides that,
Strategy:       they also provide rescue and recovery operations such as road traffic accident,
Risk            drowning cases and river rescue operations. At present Fire Service Division has
Assessment:     56 fire engines against 165 trained fire personnel stretched over 20 Dzongkhags
Beneficiary:    and 1 rescue vehicle fully equipped with rescue equipment stationed at Thimphu,
                The Fire Service Division also installed Fire hydrant system in six Dzongs and fire
                alarm system in three historical Dzongs namely Tashichho dzong, Trongsa Dzong
                and Punakha Dzong. The trend of fire accidents has been constant at 40 cases for
                the last three years, however, the service was not up to the mark due to lack of
                infrastructure and manpower in all the dzongkhags and major towns. Therefore,
                it is proposed to strengthen fire and rescue services with the establishment of an
                independent fire service department under MoHCA.
                The Fire Service Division also provided fire safety trainings to the institutes and
                public and till date a total of 7992 people have been trained. Such training will
                be continued in the 11th plan to prevent and curb down the fire incidences in the
                country.
                i. Establishment of regional fire brigade with fire stations along with

                     accommodation and other necessary fire equipment in all the dzongkhags.
                ii. The fire service division will also continue to train institutes and general public

                     on fire safety and rescue services and create awareness among the general
                     public using media such as BBS, Kuensel from time to time. Brochures and
                     pamphlet will also be developed to distribute to the general public.
                Inadequate fund and lack of manpower might impact the successful
                implementation of the proposed activities.

Justification:  The Prison Service Department administers 8 prisons including Youth

Assessment:     of the prisons which has acceded to many issues such as difficulty in maintaining
Beneficiary:    discipline and security, poor health and hygiene, and increase in conflict and
                violence in the prison.
                There is also a difficulty in rehabilitating the prisoners leading to increase in
                recidivism. Further, it is increasingly realized that the increase in number of
                prisoners also increases liabilities to the society.
                The RBP is also constrained many factors such as shortage of manpower,
                accommodation for prison guards and poor security system and facilities. In view
                of this, it is proposed to strengthen prison facilities for improved security.
                i. The Prison Service Department proposes to construct a rehabilitation center

                     at Dolongang with capacity of 500 prisoners to decongest current jails.
                ii. Adequate accommodation and other facilities for the police personnel will

                     be provided to encourage deliver prompt services.
                iii. Efforts to re-integrate former convicts into the social mainstream will also

                     be made by introducing rehabilitative programs such as vocational skill
                     development, non-formal education system, counseling programs, etc. to
                     productively engage the prisoners.
                iv. Provision of adequate security systems in prisons to strengthen security at
                     prisons.
                Financial constraint and lack of technical capacities in the department might
                constraint the successful implementation of the constructions. Also the success
                of the major reform in the management of prisons will depends on the efficiency
                and effectiveness of the security system.

Justification:  The Royal Bhutan Police is a law enforcement agency mandated to maintain
                law and order in the Kingdom and provide security to life and property with
Strategy:       quality services to the public. Since its establishment in 1965, the RBP was able
Risk            to maintain law and order in the country, however with the growing population
Assessment:     and urbanization, the crime rate particularly among the youth is increasing
Beneficiary:    almost every year. On the other hand, the RBP is not fully equipped to deal with
                such crimes with limited infrastructure, facilities and technologies. Therefore,
                RBP proposed to strengthen its services with better infrastructure facilities,
                technologies and human resources. This will contribute greatly to maintenance
                of law and order, reducing and preempting crime particularly among the youth
                in the country.
                i. Modernization of policing and crime detection using the appropriate

                     technologies such as CCTV
                ii. Develop Automated Fingerprint Information System for improved crime

                     detection and conviction
                iii. Building human resource capacity in new and emerging areas
                iv. Police outreach services strengthened to provide close monitoring and

                     timely execution of the services
                i. Budget being unavailable at the right time could constrain the implementation

                     of plans.
                ii. If adequate and skilled personnel are not available, it will affect the

                     implementation of plans.

Processes for Vibrant Electoral Democracy

Justification:  Elections play a critical role in enhancing, promoting and fostering growth
                of electoral democracy and participation of citizens of Bhutan. Sustaining
Strategy:       participation in the electoral process is becoming a challenge as evident in the
Risk            falling voter participation rates. Therefore it is crucial that all citizens including
Assessment:     youth are adequately informed and educated to actively engage in electoral
Beneficiary:    and democratic process. In terms of gender representation, women need to
                be actively encouraged to participate as candidates to allow for better election
                outcomes.
                The Parliamentary and Local Government elections of the past have resulted
                in tremendous learning. Strengthening of the electoral process needs to be
                undertaken to ensure improving cost effectiveness, efficiency and transparency in
                the conduct of elections. Also, it should facilitate the participation of all eligible
                voters with minimum errors and in a cost effective manner.
                i. To improve the efficiency and effectiveness in the conduct of elections, ICT
                will be increasingly used as a tool to manage the election process, advocacy and
                dissemination of results.
                ii. The Election Commission through construction of its Head Office will strengthen
                the institution through availability of adequate office space and thereby improve
                its service delivery.
                iii. Human Resource Capacities of its staff at the headquarters as well as in the
                districts will be developed to strengthen the capacities of the ECB.
                i. Inadequate resources to implement plans in a timely manner
                ii. Inadequate Human resources
                iii. Political uncertainties could affect the election schedule

Program Name: Strengthening Institutional  Phase: Draft
Capacity and Audit Service Delivery

Justification:  In order to deliver its mandates as enshrined in the Constitution and the Audit Act
                of Bhutan 2006, it is imperative for the RAA to embrace sustained development
Strategy:       of core skills and capabilities to carry out its task efficiently and effectively. RAA's
Risk            core mandate is to produce credible audit reports which inform on the economy,
Assessment:     efficiency and effectiveness in the use of public resources. This task of RAA is
Beneficiary:    getting more challenging with greater complexity and expansion in the socio-
                economic development activities.
                In its efforts to gain national and international credibility as the SAI of Bhutan,
                it must continue to build its organizational capacity and systems. Streamlining
                its audit procedures by conforming it to QA guidelines and external assurances
                on the processes of auditing and reporting will be some major measures it
                will undertake to strengthen the institution and its credibility. Furthermore,
                investments in building and enhancing the HR and professional expertise in RAA
                will continue.
                i. Strengthen the institution by carryout a restructuring process concerning

                     the creation of additional Divisions and investing in HRD for auditors in key
                     priority areas.
                ii. Enhance co-ordination with key stakeholders such as ACC, OAG through
                     development of co-ordination protocols.
                iii. Streamline audit procedures and adopting best practices in auditing, plough
                     back feedback from peer reviews and client satisfaction surveys to improve
                     the system.
                iv. Re-enforce the importance of audit reports for deterring corrupt practices,
                     through advocacy targeting MPs, local government representatives, public
                     and civil servants, and public at large.
                i. If adequate human and financial resources are not provided, it will hamper
                     the successful implementation of the plan
                ii. The plan is also dependent on support and co-operation from key
                     stakeholders like ACC, OAG, National Parliament. Without their support, it
                     will be challenging for RAA to achieve all its outcomes.

Justification:  The RCSC has been in existence since its establishment in 1982. Today the civil

Strategy:       a pivotal role in the development and modernization of the nation as well as
Risk            strengthening its security and sovereignty. For most of its existence, the
Assessment:     challenge for RCSC has been to pursue the policy of small, compact and efficient
Beneficiary:    Civil Service.
                In the past, the brightest talent would choose the civil service and continue in
                the service until their retirement. However, this trend is gradually changing and
                retaining good and qualified staff is becoming a challenge. Also, optimizing and
                maximizing the investments made in HR to contribute to nation building and
                strengthening the civil service is critical. Furthermore, motivating and managing
                civil servants to perform better and productively for delivering professional and
                quality services is another challenge. (no strategy/activity for small and compact
                CS)

                i. Review and strengthen performance management system to make the civil
                     service system efficient, effective and accountable. This involves enhancing
                     the overall management of recruitment, transfer, promotion and discipline
                     in the civil service. Also, the CSI System will be revamped and updated to
                     ensure timely information for decision making.

                ii. Develop and implement a strategic HRD master plan for civil servants to
                     augment the management of trainings as a critical investment in HR for
                     improving skills, knowledge and attitudes. In addition, monitor the utilization
                     of acquired knowledge to ensure optimization of HRD investments.

                iii. Motivate civil servants through institutionalization of a reward and
                     recognition system.

                i. Budgetary constraints can affect the timely implementation of plans.
                ii. The implementation of HR development and management plans depends

                     on the support and co-operation of all government agencies and therefore
                     can pose a risk in the timely implementation of plans according to the scope
                     envisaged in the programme.

Au Name: ANTI-CORRUPTION COMMISSION                             Department: SECRETARIAT
Program Name: Minimize corruption through Education, Pre-       Phase: Approved
vention and Investigation and strengthen ACC as a strong and
credible institution

Justification:  Corruption gravely undermines democratic institutions and the rule of law,
                retards sustainable economic development, distorts fair business practices and
Strategy:       exacerbates poverty. It is also known be to key reasons explaining extreme
Risk            poverty and underdevelopment prevalent in many countries. Corruption in
Assessment:     Bhutan is relatively low and is mostly prevalent in the form of misuse of public
Beneficiary:    resources, abuse of public authority to collusion and fronting in procurement
                contracts, bribery and tax evasion.
                As a small country founded on the GNH philosophy, Bhutan cannot afford to have
                any form of corruption. In an effort to effectively manage and reduce corruption in
                Bhutan, the Anit-corruption Commission was established in 2005. The commission
                through the implementation of various initiatives has made significant progress in
                combating corruption over the past decade. Going forward, the commission will
                continue its effort in making Bhutan free of corruption.
                Fighting corruption is a multi -sectoral responsibility and good governance is
                fundamental to curbing corruption. The ACC will take a lead role firstly by directly
                participating in prevention, education and investigation; and secondly, the ACC
                will make every effort to prevent good people from falling prey to unlimited
                opportunities by way of systemic lapses. Thirdly, the ACC will built partnership
                with public/private and non-governmental agencies, civil society and public at
                large to create a strong anti- corruption/culture characterized by intolerance
                towards corruption.
                i. Lack of ownership and cooperation by other stakeholders;
                ii. Lack of political will;
                iii. Inadequate budget;
                iv. The Recruitment and retaining professionals;
                v. Social alienation and victimization of the Investigation Officers and risks to

                     their families and relatives;
                vi. Lack of Human Resource Management autonomy

Au Name: OFFICE OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL  Department: SECRETARIAT

Program Name: Strengthening of the Public Prosecution System Phase: Approved

Justification:  Upholding of Rule of Law is a basic tenet of democratic governance. The Of-
                fice of the Attorney General contributes to this outcome through prosecution of
Strategy:       criminal and corruption cases and ensuring the administration of justice without
Risk            fear, favor and undue delays.
Assessment:     The objectives of the Office of the Attorney General in the 11th Five Year Plan is
Beneficiary:    to provide a transparent, efficient, accountable prosecution system in the coun-
                try. Such a system will immensely contribute in upholding the rule of law and
                making our society corruption free. The OAG also provides legal counsel and
                information to Government agencies.
                To improve the delivery of its services, the OAG needs to invest in improving its
                case management system making it into a web based IT system. It also needs to
                strengthen the process of prosecution by developing and adhering to standard
                protocols. Furthermore, to standardize and allow for consistency in the drafting
                of laws, a drafting manual is essential. These efforts will contribute to enhance
                the prosecution works and provide faster and fairer justice to the general public.
                i. Strengthen the system of prosecution through the development of a

                     prosecution handbook for the prosecutors, which will regulate the code of
                     conduct and ethics of the prosecutors.
                ii. Pursue ICTization of prosecution case management system to make it more
                     efficient and effective.
                iii. Augment and standardize the legal drafting process through a developing
                     drafting manual to be used as a national drafting standard of laws for all
                     ministries and agencies.
                iv. Continue and intensify efforts in educating the public on youth and family
                     related laws.
                i. Budget constraints may impede the smooth implementation of activities.
                ii. Lack of personnel in terms of numbers as well as technical expertise will
                     affect the quality and efficiency of OAG's work.
                iii. Ministries and Agencies may not comply with the drafting guidelines or
                     the prosecution handbook, which may result in the continuation of current
                     challenges of inconsistencies and other issues.
                iv. Successful outcomes for OAG depends on the collaboration and co-opera-
                     tion with RBP, ACC and also the public at large. This may not be forthcom-
                     ing and therefore is a definite risk for OAG.

                There is a huge demand for quality statistics and data more so with the introduc-
                tion of Results Based Management in the Five Year Plans. The NSB shall strength-
                en statistics for evidence-based development through quality surveys, timely
                production of national reports, systematic data collection and documentation.
                NSB shall also develop a National Statistics Act to standardize policy and proce-
                dures pertaining to the planning, implementation and management of statistics.
                This will promote adherence to statistical standards and approaches leading to
                more reliable/credible data generation.
                i. Continue to conduct nationwide surveys and disseminate the statistical

                     information widely to allow for evidence based decision making.
                ii. Strengthen legal and regulatory framework through drafting of statistical

                     legislation and policies, thereby enhancing statistical coordination and
                     standards and leading ultimately to more reliable data generation.
                iii. Strengthen the human resource capacities of statistical staff to continue to
                     conduct research and improve overall soundness of data generation and
                     analysis.
                iv. Institute a National Data Bank system through improved cross-sectoral
                     coordination amongst all agencies that carryout out surveys and generate
                     statistical data. This will also facilitate easy access to official statistics.
                v. Develop environmental statistics and accounting system in line with RGoB's
                     policy of sustainable development.
                i. The surveys and censuses are often funded by development partners. This
                     raises the risk of future sustainability once assistance from development
                     partners is not forthcoming.
                ii. The shortage of experts and specialists in statistics especially in new and
                     emerging themes.
                iii. Dependence on several publications on secondary data which if not devel-
                     oped using credible statistical methods may results in the publications being
                     unreliable.
                iv. Data collection and generation depends on good co-ordination and co-op-
                     eration amongst its producers. There is a risk that co-operation with other
                     producers may not always be forthcoming.

Management

Justification:  In the study done by the Institute of Management Studies in collaboration with
Strategy:       the Bhutan National Legal Institute on "Access to Justice in Bhutan" revealed that
Risk            the human resource development challenge topped the list with 44.1%. The bulk
Assessment      of the needs expressed was in professional development of the court staff at
                85.2%. Therefore, capacity development was found imperative for judiciary.
                In terms of service delivery, the current case management systems are managed
                manually, thereby making it inefficient, prone to errors and lacking transparency
                and accountability. This greatly needs to be revamped and made into a system
                using IT as a tool.
                Currently, many courts in the country are functioning from inside the Dzong
                where they are sharing the space with District/Dungkhag administration. Many
                do not have adequate space and facilities which affects service delivery. Also
                having separate court houses symbolically promotes the independence of the
                Judiciary and confidence of people.
                i. To professionalize the Judiciary, investments in human resources both at

                     professional and management level will be made. Besides long-term and
                     short term training opportunities, the judiciary shall try to build capacities
                     through other platforms like peer exchange programs, on the job trainings,
                     mentoring, institutional linkages etc.
                ii. Simultaneously, work will be undertaken to ICTize Judicial services. This is in
                     line with the Judiciary's objective to reduce its TAT time for service delivery
                     and make it transparent and effective. This will be developed through
                     extensive consultations with all key stakeholders.
                iii. Project management teams will be formed with proper authority and
                     responsibility to implement the construction projects. The committee will
                     be well equipped to plan and manage construction project activities.
                i. If sufficient financial resources are not received, it will hamper the delivery
                     of its plans.
                ii. IT initiatives depend on the access and stability of the OPGW network.

Beneficiary: The public at large, and Government and Corporate agencies.

Program Name: Institutional development and capacity building of     Phase: Approved
Royal Institute of Law

Justification:  With the significant social, cultural, and economic changes taking place, there
                is a need to strengthen the judicial system to provide the necessary judicial
                functions and uphold rule of law which is critical for the development of any
                country.
                Recognizing this need, the establishment of a legal institute and research
                centre was initiated in 2009 to develop and enhance the capacities of legal
                professionals and expertise. Currently, there is no tertiary education institute
                that provides legal education. Except for the diploma course in National Law
                offered by Royal Institute of Management, students have to pursue their legal
                studies at university level, outside the country. The Royal Institute of Law aims to
                be an autonomous tertiary level law institute providing undergraduate degree
                in law. It will also provide for research on development of the legal system in th

Strategy:       i. A Strategic Plan/Detailed Project Report will be developed as the first major
                     activity.

Beneficiary:         teaching materials development and construction of infrastructure for the
                     Law School shall be implemented in tandem and in a phased manner starting
                     from 2013.

                iii. The Royal Institute of Law will engage both national and international
                     faculties for the law school to form a balanced team of faculty.

                i. There is a probable risk of not finding capable faculties for the law school
                     once it is established.

Justification:    BNLI is an independent entity established as per the Judicial Service Act 2007.
                  It is mandated to provide continuing legal education to enhance capacity of in-
Strategy:         service judicial personnels and others involved in the administration of justice.
Risk              Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) is considered as most effective mode of
Assessment:       settling disputes amicably and maintaining harmony in the society. However,
Beneficiary:      the recent statistics indicates that only few people use this mode of dispute
                  resolution. This is evident from the fact that even petty civil cases are being filed
                  before the courts which requires lot of time and money. It is therefore become
                  very important to revitalize ADR system in our society.
                  With the new form of governance, the right to information and awareness on
                  individual rights and responsibilities has become crucial. Only an informed
                  citizen and transparency of information will lead to successful democratic
                  governance.
                  i. Strengthen advocacy and awareness through legal dissemination

                       programmes.
                  ii. Strengthen and institutionalize Alternate Dispute Resolution
                  iii. Build formal institutional linkage with similar institutes abroad while

                       currently working in close coordination with relevant stakeholders within
                       the country to ensure proper and timely completion of its planned activities.
                  iv. Strengthen Child Justice System
                  i. Bhutan National Legal Institute is currently facing acute shortage of
                       competent professionals to execute its programs. However, to overcome
                       this shortfall, the institute is coordinating with the Judiciary to engage
                       judges to delivers trainings and conduct other programs. The institute is
                       also in the process of grooming its own young professionals in the field of
                       providing continuing legal education and other programs for its targeted
                       beneficiaries.

Program Name: Protection and Promotion of the Rights  Phase: Approved
of Women and Children

Justification:  The National Council for Women and Children is the agency tasked with the
                protection and promotion of the rights of women and children. Currently being
Strategy:       at the initial stages of establishing a comprehensive gender mainstreaming and
Risk            child protection systems, it is imperative to ensure continuance of programmes
Assessment:     for a systematic promotion and protection of women and children's rights.
Beneficiary:    As part of Government's commitment to addressing the needs of women and
                children, increased emphasis needs to be placed on gender mainstreaming and
                child protection in the 11th FYP. This is also strongly aligned to the National Key
                Result of Good Governance "Creating a gender friendly environment for women's
                participation and leadership". Similarly, another key priority will be to ensure
                that children's right to protection is enhanced as a primary strategy towards
                addressing their vulnerability.
                Generation of sex disaggregated data can only lead to better planning and
                budgeting, thus strengthening the evidences of results. Furthermore, in the
                process of generating disaggregated data, it will give an explicit picture of the
                ground realities thus determining state interventions which will be responsive.
                i. Strengthen inter-agency co-ordination by instituting a monitoring and

                     co-ordination system. In support of this develop a central database for
                     managing and analyzing information better.
                ii. Enhance Gender mainstreaming through developing a gender indicator
                     handbook to guide all agencies in Gender Mainstreaming, advocacy and
                     incorporation of women empowerment in mainstream education curricula.
                iii. Augment the legal framework to enhance participation and protection of
                     women and children through review of existing and new legislation from a
                     gender/ child perspective. Furthermore, continue to implement Acts- Child
                     Care and Protection, Child Adoption, Domestic Violence Prevention.
                iv. Establish support services to enhance participation and protection of women
                     and children.
                v. Continue advocacy through media and other platforms on the protection
                     and promotion of children and women.
                i. Shortage of manpower both in terms of numbers and technical capacities of
                     staff to implement the plans.
                ii. Low level of understanding/ acceptance of gender and child protection
                     issues will impede the smooth implementation of the plans.
                iii. Inadequate financial resources will affect the implementation of plans. Many
                     of the programmes of NCWC are donor dependent and with many of our
                     development partners phasing out, the continuation of these plans in the
                     future is questionable.

                Eleventh Five Year Plan - Programme Profile - Volume II

Au Name: GROSS NATIONAL HAPPINESS COMMISSION Department: SECRETARIAT

Program Name: Rural Economic Advancement  Phase: Approved
Programme (Phase II)

Justification:  The Royal Government of Bhutan accorded highest priority in addressing poverty
                during the 10 Five Year Plan (2008-2013) and
Strategy:       continues to do so in its 11th Plan. RGoB also made several international
                commitments to address the poverty issues such as Decade of Poverty Alleviation
Risk            (2005-2015), SAARC Development Goals and Millennium Development Goals.
Assessment:     Towards this end, targeted poverty initiatives such as Rural Economic Advancement
Beneficiary:    Programme (REAP) and land rehabilitation programme were carried out.
                While the broad-based development programmes continue to alleviate poverty,
                the REAP shall seek to target the extreme poverty that may not be adequately
                addressed through broad-based development programmes. Given the significant
                contribution of the REAP I to national objectives of poverty reduction, the GNH
                Commission has decided to upscale the targeted programme in 11th FYP covering
                the poorest villages across 20 Dzongkhags.
                i. REAP II shall carry out its interventions at the village level and the poorest villages
                shall be selected using objective criteria, namely, multi-dimensional poverty
                index (MPI). To promote participation and address poverty and deprivations in
                the six dimensions, communities shall prepare respective village development
                plans (VDP). Furthermore income generating activities shall cover the entire
                value chain to ensure effective interventions
                ii. Special activities targeted at the poorest households in the village shall
                be implemented as they have difficulties capitalizing on the more general
                interventions.
                iii. Promote Government and Non- Government participation and partnerships
                to allow for synergy and complementary in work. iv. Conduct timely monitoring
                and evaluation, and provide feedback to continuously refine and sharpen the
                interventions.
                i. The successful implementation of the REAP depends on the support and co-
                operation of Dzongkhag and Gewog Administrations who will be the implementing
                partner. If support is not forthcoming, it will affect the timely and effective
                implementation of plans.
                ii. If adequate financial resources are not made available, it will jeopardize the
                implementation of REAP activities.

Justification:  Land is not simply an economic issue but an issue affecting the very livelihoods
                and welfare of the people to a large extent. As an agrarian country, land plays an
Strategy:       important role in uplifting the livelihood and poverty of the majority of Bhuta-
Risk            nese population. Therefore equal access to and ownership of land will provide
Assessment:     strong foundation for inclusive growth and development. Poverty alleviation or
Beneficiary:    economic dynamism - both ends of the spectrum of government priorities are
                affected by land issues. It will therefore be imperative for Bhutan to strengthen
                land information management and improve land related services.
                Similarly, we cannot hope to create a dynamic financial sector or attract foreign
                investment, if land transaction and allotment procedures are not transparent,
                reliable and efficient. As such, it is important to streamline and strengthen land
                administration and management system of Bhutan
                i. Improve and strengthen land registration and transaction services
                ii. Improve multipurpose cadastre information
                iii. Develop and establish geo-spatial infrastructure
