      RAPID INTEGRATED ASSESSMENT Â­ LIBERIA SDG PROFILE

UNDP undertook a Rapid Integrated Assessment of Liberia's Agenda for Transformation (AFT) 2012-2017
complemented with reference to the Economic and Stabilization and Recovery Plan (ESRP) of April 2015
which seeks to identify strategic interventions to stabilize and promote rapid economic and social
recovery following the Ebola Virus Disease (EVD) crisis in Liberia. The assessment provides a gap analysis
of the SDG targets not prioritized in the AFT. Such analysis can inform the formulation of the next Liberia's
national development plan facilitating alignment to the SDGs based on national priorities.
Template 1 provides a quick visual overview of the SDG targets integrated in the 2012-2017 AFT and those
that are not. It also shows the SDG targets that are prioritized by multiple sectors as captured in the AFT
and the ESRP and missing linkages across sectors.

                                                                                                                               1
Template 2 provides further details, including specific reference to goals and targets drawn from the AFT,
and ESRP which constitute the starting point of the alignment analysis (different to the mapping exercise
of the AFT against the SDG and Agenda 2063 undertaken at national level which took as the starting point
the AFT key indicators). Template 2 shows as well (i) national indicators for specific targets drawn from
the 52 key indicators of the AFT validated in 2014 and the AFT itself,1 and (ii) responsible or lead institution
overseeing implementation of the target.

The following observations result from the assessment:
    1. The AFT prioritizes 65 SDG targets out of 106 (169 SDG targets minus 43 on means of
         implementation under each of the goals; 19 targets of Goal 17 on partnerships and target 14.7
         which do not apply to developing countries). The analysis shows important gaps in terms of
         alignment which may help inform the formulation of the next national development plan to either
         confirm such SDG targets do not constitute priority at national level or work towards inclusion of
         relevant targets in the next planning process.
    2. The SDG targets listed below are not integrated in the AFT. Since the analysis is based on the AFT
         and ESRP only, consideration of sectoral policies and strategies may reduce these gaps and should
         be taken into account while formulating the next national development plan to factor in the
         results and lessons learned from the implementation such policies and strategies.

pace of progress, give insights and impulses to stakeholders on whether progress is in line with the AFT, and

1. Gaps are particularly prominent with respect to Goals 12, 14 and 15 related to sustainable
    production and consumption; oceans, seas and marine resources; and terrestrial ecosystems,
    forests, land degradation and biodiversity, respectively. It is worth mentioning that goals 12 and
    15 are included among the 11 priority Goals for Liberia captured in the Buchanan CommuniquÃ©
    on the SDGs of November 2015.

2. The analysis shows that targets related to Goal 10 on inequality are prioritized under 16 of the
    38 sectors of the AFT used for the analysis. This is in part due to the AFT's focus on vulnerable
    groups such as persons with disabilities, youth, women (gender equality), persons living with HIV
    and AIDS, and children (child protection). But also by the emphasis on smallholder farmers or
    youth and women, etc. in pillar II of the AFT on economic transformation.

                                                                                                                          5
3. The assessment equally highlights a good coverage of Goal 16 on peaceful and inclusive societies.

4. Resilience and reducing vulnerabilities to shocks and disasters, including those induced by
    climate-extreme events (ADG target 1.5), are not integrated in the AFT though are part of the
    ESRP which defines strengthening resilience and reducing vulnerability as one of three foreseen
    strategies for economic stabilization and recovery. Going forward, it may be worth reflecting upon
    the importance of mainstreaming disaster risk reduction and resilience considerations as part of
    the national development planning process to strengthen the capacity of communities and the
    country as a whole to respond to crisis such as the EVD in future.

5. The integration of nutrition in AFT is limited (target 2.2 on ending all forms of malnutrition) with
    emphasis placed instead under the agriculture and food security sector, on the need for
    modernizing and enhancing productivity of the agriculture and fisheries sectors, including by
    strengthening smallholder agriculture. Revitalizing the agriculture sector is important is light of
    high levels of food insecurity in the country (less than half the population is food secure).
    Nevertheless, nutrition is equally important. According to the African Health Observatory2 42% of
    Liberian children aged under 5 years are stunted, increasing their risk of dying from normal
    childhood illness and risk of chronic illness later in life. The same source indicates a National
    Nutrition Policy (2009) and a National Nutrition and Food Security Strategy are available. Further
    exploration of this issue by reference to these sectoral policies and strategies and results of their
    implementation would be useful in the context of the next national development planning
    process and alignment to the SDGs.

6. AFT does not prioritize target 3.4 on reducing premature mortality from non-communicable
    diseases and promoting mental health and deficiencies. According to the World Health
    Organization3 non-communicable diseases currently account for an estimated 34% of death in the
    country. The same source indicates the country lacks operational plans, policies or strategies to
    address these diseases and risks factors. Given the relatively high rate of death associated to these
    diseases, it may be worth considering whether such gaps need to be covered in the next national
    development planning cycle. The African Health Observatory of the WHO indicates mental health
    though the subject of a national sector policy (2009) and part of the basic package of health
    services4 suffers from important implementation challenges.

7. Among the gaps exposed by the analysis, target 3.7 related to access to sexual and reproductive
    healthÂ­care services, including for family planning is worth given attention to. The fertility rate
    is high and increased from 5.2 birth per woman aged 15-49 in 2007 to 5.9 births per woman in
    2009. The country has a large share of youth population: 49% of the population is younger than

    15 years old. On the other hand, Liberia's contraceptive prevalence rate is of 11.4% and unmet
    needs for family planning are high at 36%.5 Gender equality and women's empowerment are
    important to improve reproductive health as is access to a package of reproductive health
    services, including family planning.

8. The assessment shows that target 11.3 on inclusive and sustainable urbanization and capacity
    for human settlement planning and management is not integrated in AFT. This in in spite of the
    AFT recognizing that urbanization in Liberia Â­partly as a consequence of the civil war- is larger
    than in other low income countries. According to UNHABITAT,6 more than 40% of Liberia's urban
    population now lives in the Greater Monrovia area and an estimated 70% of Monrovia's
    population currently lives in slum conditions as a consequence of unplanned urbanization. While
    the AFT defines targets for ensuring access to public housing for the poor and transport services,
    for instance, there is no reference to broader issues of urban planning. This is important to ensure
    that increasing urbanization goes hand in hand with infrastructure development, planning for
    service provision such as health and education, and avoiding environmental degradation related
    to slums proliferation and concomitant health and other risks.

9. Reference to fisheries and marine resources in the AFT are sparse though fisheries is one of the
    sectors identified in the AFT as growth sector and in the National Export Strategy as a driver for
    trade expansion. Among the gaps exposed by the alignment assessment is target 14.4 on
    regulating harvesting and end overfishing, illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing (IUU)
    practices. According to Liberia's 2008 Diagnostic Trade integration Study undertaken under the
    auspices of the Enhanced Integrated Framework, the fisheries sector is underdeveloped and
    suffers from important institutional weaknesses. The report specifically highlights the significant
    incidence of IUU practices7 which both undermine the resource base and government revenue
    necessary for development. Further analysis may be necessary to understand whether sectoral
    policies address this gap.

10. With respect to means of implementation (Goal 17), the assessment shows the Government of
    Liberia have made emphasis on domestic resource mobilization in the AFT acting in several fronts:
    from improving public financial management in general, to increasing government revenue from
    mineral and forest resource exploitation, including by enhancing transparency and monitoring of
    activities by firms in these sectors. Financing of SDGs is a critical consideration for Liberia given its
    limited fiscal space further undermined by the EVD crisis. The ESRP stresses the importance of
    securing on-going budget support financing to cover the shortfalls resulting from the EVD crisis.
    It also underlines the need for development partners to disburse committed funds to Liberia for
    USD 1.6 billion and finance additional infrastructure projects for USD 1.2 billion. These issues were
    discussed in the context of the International Ebola Recovery Conference held in July 2015 which
    led to pledges of USD 500 million to support the ESRP.

11. In addition to domestic resource mobilization and ODA, the AFT seeks to create an enabling
    environment for private sector development as driver of growth and employment creation, and
    trade development, by strengthening value chains and increasing local value added. In this
    context FDI, access to regional and international markets, access to technology, etc. Â­ all areas
    covered by different targets in Goal 17- are of relevance to Liberia. As the country defines its
    priorities for the next development planning cycle and implementation of the SDG an engagement
    strategy to mobilize the finance and partnerships to support the country's priorities would be
    useful.

12. The Key indicators for monitoring implementation of the AFT to a large extent seek data
    disaggregation by groups such as women and youth; and location Â­i.e. urban/rural and per county
    where applicable.

13. Template 1 without being exhaustive, highlights missing inter-sectoral linkages resulting from the
    AFT assessment. Further analysis is needed inclusive of relevant sectoral policies and strategies
    to confirm or not these gaps and identify others not covered therein. Beyond the gap analysis, it
    will be very important, responding to the integrated nature of Agenda 2030 and the SDGs, to
    consider what is the best institutional framework to promote cross-sectoral collaboration
    throughout the development planning cycle - from situation assessment to prioritization,
    implementation of programmes and interventions, monitoring and evaluation, building on the
    national experience with the implementation of AFT and other sectoral policies and strategies.
