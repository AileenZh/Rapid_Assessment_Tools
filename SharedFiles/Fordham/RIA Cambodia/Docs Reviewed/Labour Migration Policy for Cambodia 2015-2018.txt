FOREWORD

The Royal Government of Cambodia and the Ministry of Labour and Vocational Training is
pleased to launch the Labour Migration Policy for Cambodia 2015-2018. This Policy builds
on the previous Policy on Labour Migration for Cambodia 2010-2015, expanding on the
three main objectives of (1) formulation and implementation of rights-based and gender-
sensitive policy and legislation through social dialogue at all levels; (2) protection and
empowerment of men and women migrant workers regardless of their status through all stages
of the migration process; and (3) harnessing labour migration and mobility to enhance
social and economic development in Cambodia recognising that migrant workers are agents
of innovation and development. The Policy includes clear goals related to migration and
development, migration management and the protection of migrant workers, and specific actions
designed to achieve these goals. The document also provides a structure for monitoring and
evaluation of the implementation of the policy, filling an identified gap in the implementation of
the previous policy.

The Labour Migration Policy for Cambodia 2015-2018 responds to the identified need for the
Royal Government of Cambodia to introduce measures to ensure that new job seekers can be
productively employed and develop their skills to be able to work in emerging, rather than
vulnerable sectors in both Cambodia and destination countries. In this way the Policy and
Action Plan links to the in-development Cambodia National Employment Policy, which supports
the mobility of workers and protection of migrant workers under the goal of enhancing labour
market governance, but also places employment generation (quantity and quality) at the heart
of economic and social policy-making, focusing on young women and men. The Policy and
Action Plan also links to the National Strategic Development Plan 2014-2018, which frames
emigration as a population issue to work on in association with other line ministries and
agencies, to strengthen its human resources for integrating population-related issues into the
development planning processes at all levels for planners and policy makers. The Rectangular
Strategy Phase III 2013-2018 also demonstrates a strong commitment by the Government to
promote employment as a central part of their medium-term development strategy and institute
a policy framework such that productive employment generation and economic development
occur in tandem.

With aligned goals and timeframes included within the Labour Migration Policy for
Cambodia, the National Employment Policy, the National Strategic Development Plan, and the
Rectangular Strategy Phase III, the Department of Employment and Manpower, Ministry of
Labour and Vocational Training, looks forward to collaborating through a whole-of- Government
approach to labour migration management for positive outcomes for Cambodians. This Policy
has the premise that when well-managed, labour migration can contribute to family and
community development, and reduce poverty at community and national levels. Whilst the Royal
Government of Cambodia does not view labour migration as the only avenue for pursuing
Cambodia's long-term national economic and social development goals, the Royal Government
of Cambodia is committed to ensuring that Cambodians are migrating for employment not out
of necessity, but rather making an informed choice whilst being protected and empowered
throughout the migration cycle.

 5
 

This Policy and Action Plan is the result of several consultations between the Royal Government
of Cambodia, workers' and employers' organizations, recruitment agencies, civil society
groups and international organizations. The Policy has also been reviewed against the
recommendations emerging from the ASEAN Forum on Migrant Labour, to ensure
coherence with regional priorities. I would like to express my gratitude to all parties involved in
the development of this policy, especially to the International Labour Organization (ILO) for their
invaluable technical support.
The Ministry of Labour and Vocational Training stands ready to guide policy-makers, line
Ministries, civil society organizations and individuals towards the full and effective application
and implementation of this Policy and Action Plan.

                                                                                Phnom Penh......................2014
                                                                                                       H.E It Sam Heng

Acknowledgements

The General Department of Labour, Ministry of Labour and Vocational Training (MOLVT),
Royal Government of Cambodia, is grateful for the support of all stakeholders during the
development of the Labour Migration Policy for Cambodia 2015-2018. The formulation process
has included a series of consultations involving tripartite stakeholders, including the Ministry of
Interior, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation, the Ministry of Women's
Affairs, the Ministry of Social Affairs, Veterans and Youth Rehabilitation, the Council of
Ministers, the Secretariat of the National Committee to Counter Human Trafficking, and
the National Employment Agency. Stakeholders have also included the Cambodian Federation
of Employers and Business Association, the Association of Cambodian Recruitment Agencies,
the Cambodia Confederation of Trade Union, National Union Alliance Chamber of Cambodia,
Cambodian Labour Confederation, and non- governmental organizations, in particular Legal
Support for Children and Women, the Cambodian Development Resource Institute, Winrock
International and The Asia Foundation for providing facilitation support at consultations. Inputs
were also provided by international organizations, including the International Labour
Organization (ILO) and UN Women. These consultations and the printing of this Policy were
supported by the Australian Government. The MOLVT would like to express its gratitude
for the valuable contributions to this endeavour from all stakeholders.

This Policy would not have been realized without the strong support and commitment of the
senior officials of the General Department of Labour, including H.E. Hou Vuthy, Under Secretary
of State; H.E. Seng Sakda, Director-General of General Department of Labour; Mr Chuop
Narath, Deputy Director of General Department of Labour; Mr Ouk Ravuth, Chief of Bureau of
Department of Employment and Manpower; and its dedicated staff members. The MOLVT
would particularly like to express its appreciation to the ILO, and in particular Ms Jane Hodge,

Executive summary

The Labour Migration Policy for Cambodia 2015-2018 sets out a framework from which to
govern labour migration effectively, empower and protect the rights of women and men migrant
workers, and enhance the impact of migration on development. It is based on an analysis of
the current context of labour migration in Cambodia, including figures and trends in relation to
sectors and destinations, the gendered dimensions of migration, and the national, bilateral,
regional and international regulatory and institutional frameworks. Economic growth and
employment trends in Cambodia are also examined, as is the demographic pressure of an
increasingly large youth workforce, the large percentage of informal employment, and what
regional integration spurred by the ASEAN Economic Community in 2015 could mean for
Cambodia.

The overall Policy objective is to develop a comprehensive and effective labour migration
governance framework that protects and empowers women and men throughout the
migration cycle, ensures that migration is an informed choice, and enables a positive and
profitable experience for individual workers, their families and communities, that also contributes
to the development of Cambodia. Recognizing and responding to the distinct needs of migrant
workers with respect to their gender, sector, legal status and other individual
characteristics, is central to the Policy and its effective implementation.

The Policy delineates three specific objectives: (1) formulation and implementation of rights-
based and gender-sensitive policy and legislation through social dialogue at all levels; (2)
protection and empowerment of men and women migrant workers regardless of their status
through all stages of the migration process; and (3) harnessing labour migration and mobility to
enhance social and economic development in Cambodia recognising that migrant workers are
agents of innovation and development.

The following policy goals are proposed under these three specific objectives:
Governance of labour migration

     Policy goal 1: International standards and instruments related to labour migration and
     migrant workers are reviewed with respect to the Cambodian context and legal framework,
     and ratified and implemented in a gender-sensitive manner.

     Policy goal 2: The Government contributes to multilateral and regional cooperation on
     labour migration, particularly within ASEAN, with a clear vision of how ASEAN regional
     integration and the ASEAN Economic Community (AEC) can enhance decent work
     opportunities for all migrant workers.

     Policy goal 3: In consultation with social partners and civil society organizations, the
     Government establishes gender-sensitive, sector specific minimum standards for MOUs
     with destination countries as a condition of sending, and key articles for contracts with
     employers prior to sending any workers abroad.

     Policy goal 4: The MOLVT invests in the capacity of the relevant bodies at central and
     provincial levels, and takes a leadership role in strengthening inter-ministerial cooperation
     on labour migration, including actively contributing to the Migration Working Group of the
     National Committee to Counter Human Trafficking.

 8
 

     Policy goal 5: New legislation and regulations are considered only where gaps are
     identified, and developed to reflect the specific and distinct needs of women and men
     migrants through tripartite consultation. Procedures related to labour migration are
     streamlined to incentivise regular migration and protect workers' rights.

     Policy goal 6: Sex-disaggregated data is collected and analysed on a regular basis to inform
     evidence-based policy that is tailored to and addresses the experiences of women
     and men migrant workers.

Protection and empowerment of men and women migrant workers

     Policy goal 7: The Government monitors and enforces protection mechanisms in the
     recruitment and placement of migrant workers, including institutionalising inspection of
     private recruitment agencies, the delivery of pre-departure training, and regulating the
     costs of migration, including brokerage fees.

     Policy goal 8: Unlicensed brokers or agents, or licensed recruitment agencies linked to
     exploitative or unscrupulous practices, are targeted with appropriate sanctions to reduce
     irregular migration and reduce the vulnerability of migrant workers.

     Policy goal 9: Government consular services are established or enhanced in major
     destination countries to provide effective assistance to men and women migrant workers
     regardless of their status, including shelter, legal, labour dispute, social protection and
     repatriation facilities.

     Policy goal 10: Migrants' access to justice is facilitated through implementing the complaints
     mechanism in an effective, gender-sensitive and timely manner. In the event of a crime,
     judicial processes are initiated to ensure an adequate penalty, and a deterrent to
     others.

     Policy goal 11: The Government facilitates migrants' access to vocational training programs
     to develop and recognize the skills of migrant workers as a measure to enhance protection
     and earning potential. Training programmes and skills recognition systems are developed
     for women and men in consultation with employers and governments of destination
     countries, according to labour market needs, in specific occupations and sectors.

     Policy goal 12: The Government cooperates with local leaders, social partners and civil
     society organizations to provide accurate and up-to-date information on safe migration and
     rights at work in major migrant-sending communities and in transit hubs.

     Policy goal 13: Feasibility studies are conducted by the Government on further
     protection mechanisms for men and women migrant workers such as the revolving
     credit and loan funds, and migrant welfare funds to assist men and women migrant workers
     with migration.

Harnessing labour migration for development

 9
 

     Policy goal 14: Labour migration continues to be included within national development and
     sectorial plans to recognize and maximise the development potential of migration for
     Cambodia, and ensure coherent development planning.
     Policy goal 15: The Government works with financial institutions in Cambodia and
     destination countries to enable access to safe, efficient and cheaper remittance and
     financial services for migrant workers. The impact of remittances on development is
     enhanced through support services provided to migrants and their families, including
     gender-sensitive financial literacy training, a broader range of financial services and
     products, and dialogue and tools for diaspora engagement.
     Policy goal 16: Productive return and reintegration of women and men migrant workers is
     enabled through evidence-based policy, and strengthened service provision for social and
     economic reintegration, including employment services, skills development and recognition,
     enterprise development training, and investment programmes.
     Policy goal 17: The social cost of migration is mitigated through specific programmes,
     including through the provision of support to the families and children of migrant
     workers.

Under each policy goal, action points are identified that are to be initiated by the responsible
agencies. The policy document serves as a road map for the Government in its dialogue with
social partners, international organizations and the donor community, to more effectively
carry out measures to enhance the positive development outcomes of migration, and establish
means to assess the achievement of results.

Introduction

With 300,000 young Cambodians entering the labour market each year, a youth unemployment
rate of 3.8 per cent, and economic growth not achieving commensurate employment growth,
more Cambodian workers are looking to employment opportunities and wages offered abroad.
Increasingly, Cambodian women are migrating to find work that allows them to support their
families. It is estimated that much higher numbers of migrant workers move irregularly than
regularly, but because of porous borders and seasonal migration flows, it is difficult to obtain
accurate figures. In this Policy when the term `migrant worker' is used, it refers to a person who
will be engaged, is engaged, or has been engaged in a remunerated activity in a State of which
he or she is not a national, and refers to both regular and irregular men and women migrant
workers.

The main country of destination for regular and irregular Cambodian migrant workers is
neighbouring Thailand. Due to the relative ease of border crossing, less than 10 per cent of
people migrate through the legal channel established under the Memorandum of Understanding
(MOU) between the two countries in 20031. Since 2010, the Republic of Korea has become
the second most popular destination. The number of migrant workers going to Malaysia
peaked in the period from 2009 to 2011, despite the lack of an MOU in place, but this number
dropped dramatically after the suspension of sending domestic workers through regular
channels. Cambodia also concluded an MOU with Japan, but far fewer migrants travel there
for work, due to the technical requirements through the Industrial Training Program and
Technical Internship Program.

Cambodia has yet to develop a comprehensive policy strategy on how to maximize the
opportunities of greater labour mobility of workers within the ASEAN region with the ASEAN
Economic Community (AEC) coming into effect in 2015. Currently, only one per cent of the
Cambodian workforce qualifies for the freer movement of professional workers for which mutual
recognition arrangements (MRAs) exist. It is expected that greater regional integration
will also lead to increased mobility for semi-skilled workers. The continued demand for
low- and medium- skilled migrant workers within the major destination countries in ASEAN is
projected to remain high, with 80 per cent of inter-ASEAN migration flowing to Malaysia,
Singapore and Thailand.

Importantly, the Government aims to ensure that migration is a choice, not a necessity. Labour
migration is only one component of the National Employment Policy, which aims to generate
employment and create better jobs at home. Labour migration is also streamlined into the
National Strategic Development Plan 2014-2018, framing emigration as a potential tool to
strengthen Cambodia's human resources, and the Rectangular Strategy Phase III
2013-2018 that demonstrates a Government commitment to promote employment and institute
a policy framework so that productive employment generation and economic development occur
in tandem. Support must be available for Cambodians to make informed decisions about
migration, and opportunities for them to migrate safely, legally and into decent work.

Over the past few years the Royal Government of Cambodia has seen positive outcomes of
migration including increasing remittances, skills acquisition, lower unemployment, and poverty

reduction. While there has been demonstrated progress governing labour migration and
protecting migrant workers, these positive results could have an enhanced impact on
individual, community and national level development by establishing policies and programmes
on the return and reintegration of workers, reducing migration costs and engaging Cambodian
returned migrants. This requires improved cooperation between all stakeholders in Cambodia,
led by an inter-ministerial Government team.

This policy document outlines the Royal Government of Cambodia's policy goals on labour
migration and the activities designed to achieve these goals.

1. Labour migration: Current context

As a result of the large number of young people entering the domestic labour market with limited
opportunities and more attractive wages offered abroad, more Cambodians are considering
leaving the country to find work. In 2010, the World Bank estimated there were 350,485
Cambodian workers migrating for employment.2 However, the number is likely much
greater, with approximately 700,000 Cambodian migrants with irregular status registering with
the Thai authorities from July to October 2014 (Table 1).

Cambodia's population is expected to grow until 2015 at an average rate of 1.3 per cent per
year, while the working-age population (aged 15Â­64) will grow at a higher average annual
rate of 3 per cent. As an estimated 300,000 young Cambodians enter the labour market
every year3 and with 60.1 per cent of the Cambodian population under 29 years of age4, the
Government faces the challenge of equipping these young people with the required skills to
meet the needs of the labour market, providing job-matching services Â­ and where necessary,
facilitating their mobility.

1.1 Wages

A key factor for Cambodian workers in choosing to migrate for work is the wage differential
between Cambodia and destination countries. In 2012, 60.2 per cent of total employed
people in Cambodia worked in informal employment, while only 6.5 per cent were salaried
employees in the formal sector.5 Even for this small amount of salaried employees, there is no
standardised form or frequency of payment (some employees are paid on a time-rate basis,
others on a piece-rate basis; payment is in cash or in kind) and there is no established minimum
wage in legislation, except for garment workers.6 The estimated average monthly income of
paid employees in 2012 was 477,517 Cambodian Riel (KHR) (US$119).7 On average, men earn
around KHR 518,202 (US$130), which is more than women who earn on average KHR 418,808
(US$105). In some occupations, the difference in the earnings between male and female
employees is larger, particularly for managers and technicians. In urban areas, managers earn

the highest average monthly income at KHR 924,815 (US$231), followed by technicians at KHR
750,728 (US$188). In rural areas, technicians earn the highest average monthly income at KHR
606,973 (US$152), followed by skilled agriculture workers at KHR 595,565 (US$149).8

In comparison, Thailand has a minimum wage of 300 Thai Baht (THB) per day, roughly equating
to THB 9,000 per month (US$279) full-time.9 While Thai labour law and the MOU with
Cambodia states that migrant workers should also receive the wage and other benefits due to
local workers, more men than women receive the minimum wage.10 In general, migrants with
full or temporary documentation earned higher incomes, whereas 65 per cent of migrants who
earned less than half of the minimum wage were without documentation.11

In a 2014 International Organization for Migration (IOM) study, it was found that the income
levels of migrants differed greatly by province of residence Â­ in non-border provinces such
as, Bangkok, Samut Sakhon and Surat Thani, 90.1, 84.3 and 93.1 per cent respectively, of
migrants received at least the minimum wage.12 Incomes were generally lower in border
provinces, especially in Tak, where 91.5 per cent of migrants received less than the
minimum wage, and half received less than half of the minimum wage. Significant sectoral
differences were also evident, for example, agriculture and animal husbandry was shown to be
a highly underpaid employment sector. Thailand's Labour Protection Act does not extend
minimum wage protection to workers in the fishing, agriculture and domestic work sectors.

In Peninsular Malaysia, the monthly minimum wage is 900 Malaysian ringgit or KHR
1,188,000 (US$295).13 This minimum wage applies to nationals and migrant workers, but not to
domestic workers, the vast majority of whom are women. Deductions made from migrant
workers' wages to cover the costs of the levy (varies according to sector) can equate to up to
16 per cent of the migrants' annual basic income.14

In the Republic of Korea, the minimum wage is 1,015,740 South Korean Won (US$922) per
month, based on the hourly minimum wage and the average number of 40 working hours per
week.15 Under the Employment Permit System (EPS), migrant workers are afforded equal
rights and treatment to Korean workers under Korean labour laws and regulations.

Across all destination countries however, migrant workers with irregular status are less likely to
be able to access the minimum wage protections.

unemployment rate is higher than men's, and a larger proportion of women workers are
illiterate16. In 2012, slightly over 20 per cent of Cambodian women had never attended
school, almost twice the percentage of men.17 Migration trends often see more educated women
migrating to Phnom Penh from provincial areas, and women with lower levels of education
migrating internationally.18 Given women's higher unemployment rates and their lower
education levels, women are typically more vulnerable than men to exploitation in the workplace.

Women tend to receive lower wages than their male counterparts but, despite this, are more
likely to remit larger net amounts, and are more likely to remit a higher proportion of their income,
and at an average 20 per cent more than men migrants. About 32 per cent of men do not remit
at all, compared to 23 per cent of women. 39 per cent of women remitted one million or more
KHR (US$242) per year, compared to 26 per cent of men.

Cambodian women migrant workers tend to migrate into low-skilled jobs in the construction,
agriculture, manufacturing, entertainment, hospitality and domestic work industries.
Domestic work in private homes is a particularly vulnerable sector, due to the isolated nature of
the workplace and limited or non-existent protection under labour laws. Reports of abuse and
exploitation of domestic workers have been recorded in all countries where Cambodian
domestic workers are employed. With an ageing population in bordering Thailand and in
countries like Malaysia and Singapore, demand for domestic workers in the region is expected
to continue to grow.

Occupations for migrants are often gender segregated, and women are regularly paid less than
men. An ILO survey of potential migrants in Cambodia found that, while the median salary
expectation among potential migrants was US$101-200 per month, 54 per cent of men
surveyed expected this wage, compared to only 43 per cent of women. Of the potential migrants
expecting to receive US$201-500 per month, 27 per cent were men and 16 per cent were
women.19 Women are more likely to remit larger net amounts, and are more likely to remit a
higher proportion of their income, and at an average 20 per cent more than men migrants20.
About 32 per cent of men do not remit at all, compared to 23 per cent of women. 39 per cent of
women remitted one million or more KHR (US$242) per year, compared to 26 per cent of men.21

In 2010, Cambodian recruitment agencies trained and sent 16,397 workers to Malaysia, of
which 11,918 were women trained as domestic workers. This was an increase from 9,982
Cambodians who migrated to Malaysia in 2009 (84 per of whom were female domestic
workers), and 2,654 in 2008 (73 per cent of whom were female domestic workers) (Table 3). In
Thailand, the number of women migrant workers deployed through legal channels has
substantially increased from 1,345 women in 2005, to the peak of 19,282 women migrant
workers in 2010 (Table 3). In contrast to Malaysia, women's and men's rates of regular
migration to Thailand have stayed fairly even, most likely due to the diversity of work sectors.

As of 31 October 2014, 696,388 migrant workers and 42,609 dependents from Cambodia
had registered at the Thai One Stop Service Centres through the nationality verification (NV)
processes (Table 1).

As of November 2014, 299 Cambodian domestic workers had been deployed to Singapore as
part of a pilot project. The pilot project will send 400 Cambodian domestic workers to Singapore
through private recruitment agencies (PRAs) to see if this is a viable migration option in the
future.

In contrast, the fishing sector is almost entirely male dominated, and employs significant
numbers of Cambodian migrant men. Since 2010, there have been increased reports of
Cambodian men encountering exploitative and abusive working conditions on fishing boats in
South Africa, Senegal, Fiji, Mauritius, Thailand and other destinations. In the first quarter of
2012 alone, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation (MOFA&IC) and the
Ministry of Interior (MOI) each reported between 170 and 200 cases of exploitation and abuse
involving fishers. Whilst the Cambodian Government has not put a formal ban on recruiting and
sending Cambodians overseas to work on fishing vessels, the Government has made several
statements indicating they do not support regular migration through PRAs into the fishing
industry.

1.3 Mass exodus of Cambodians from Thailand in 2014

In June 2014, more than 250,000 Cambodian migrant workers returned to Cambodia from
Thailand, prompted by fear of arrest by Thai authorities and the unstable political situation in
Thailand. The majority of returning migrants were undocumented, and some were travelling with
families and young children. Of the 667 returned migrants interviewed in an IOM study,
53 per cent were women, and 70 per cent of respondents were between 20-40 years old.22
Over one-third (38 per cent) of respondents had not completed primary school, and more
than two-thirds migrated to Thailand because they had no job or income in Cambodia. When
asked what type of assistance they most needed in Cambodia, 78.4 per cent of respondents
said they required help in finding a job, and 60.3 per cent required vocational skill training.23

The Cambodian Government was quick to react to the return of migrants, and aimed to simplify
and make regular migration more affordable, by issuing Sub-decree No. 205, reducing the cost
of passports for migrant workers to US$4, and inter-ministerial prakas No. 2574, stating that
migrant workers could apply for their passports at the Provincial Offices of Passport of the MOI
and Provincial Departments of Labour and Vocational Training (PDOLVTs). Prakas No. 2574
also states that the MOLVT will establish one window services for Khmer workers who have
worked and are working in Thailand, at four border check points (Banteay Mearnchey,
Pailin, Koh Kong, and Oudor Mearnchey). As of July 2014, there was one provincial passport
office in Battambang, and MOLVT was in the process of establishing the one window services
in other provinces. Early analysis indicated that these options were not taken up by migrant
workers, most of whom returned to Thailand and subsequently registered with the Thai
authorities. This exodus of migrant workers underlines the need for coherent policies on labour
migration that is better able to provide migrant workers with regular migration options, and
which invests in support for the return and reintegration of migrants to Cambodia.

2. Demographic pressure

In 2012, Cambodia's total estimated population was 14.9 million; 7.6 million (51 per cent)
female and 7.3 million (49 per cent) male24. As a result of the post-war baby boom, the
population is young, with those aged 29 years and under comprising 60.1 per cent of the
total population, those aged 30-59 comprising 32.4 per cent of the population, and those
aged over 60 comprising only 7.6 per cent of the population25.

                    Graph 1: Distribution of Cambodia's population by age, 2012

The annual population growth rate registered from 2008-2013 was 1.46 per cent, higher than
that of Southeast Asia (1.1 per cent), and much higher than that of Thailand (0.5 per cent), or
Viet Nam (1 per cent), but lower than the growth rate of Lao PDR (1.7 per cent)26.

3. Labour migration trends and frameworks

3.1 Labour migration trends

Thailand
In 2003, the Governments of Thailand and Cambodia signed an MOU on employment
cooperation as a part of the regulatory framework for labour migration, including reference within
the MOU for the need for policies to manage irregular migrants. The number of migrants using
legal channels to migrate to Thailand increased from 9,476 in 2007 to 34,804 in 2012, but then
declined again in 2013 (Table 3), at least in part due to the repeated regularization
opportunities in Thailand, the ability to avoid deportation, and limited additional protection
provided by regular migration.

In mid-2011, Thai authorities' commenced registration, and Thai and Cambodian authorities
together commenced NV processes to facilitate the regularization of workers who either
migrated through irregular channels, or whose regular migrant status had lapsed.

In late June 2014, following the exodus of Cambodian workers from Thailand, the Thai National
Committee for Peace and Order (NCPO) opened a new registration window for irregular migrant
workers, until 31 October 2014. As of October 2014, 696,388 migrant workers and 42,609
dependents had registered through the OSSCs (Table 1). The procedures and timing for NV is
currently in discussion between the Thai Government and countries of origin.

Malaysia
Malaysia is a major destination country for Cambodian migrant workers; from 2005 to 2010, legal
migration to Malaysia increased from 1,776 to 16,394 (Table 3). The demand for Cambodian
domestic workers increased dramatically after the Indonesian Government suspended sending
domestic workers to Malaysia in 2009. Following a series of reports of abuse and exploitation,
in October 2011 the Cambodian Government imposed a temporary ban on sending domestic
workers to Malaysia. In 2014, Cambodia and Malaysia continued negotiations on two separate
MOUs to restart the sending of domestic workers and `general' workers, or workers in other
sectors.

Republic of Korea
Sub-decree No. 70 issued in July 2006, on the Creation of the Manpower Training and Overseas
Sending Board (MTOSB), is a Government-to-Government system designed specifically to
regulate the sending of Cambodian workers to the Republic of Korea. The MTOSB oversees the
recruitment, training, and sending of workers to the Republic of Korea through the EPS, which
allows Korean small and medium-sized enterprises who have not been able to recruit local
workers to recruit internationally in the manufacturing, construction, agriculture and livestock,
fishing, and service industry sectors. To qualify under the EPS, workers must demonstrate a
sufficient level of language and job skills. The EPS involves training prior to departure,
support while in country, and skills and job matching services upon return. Four types of
insurance are available to migrant workers Â­ workers' compensation insurance, health
insurance, pension insurance and employment insurance. Since 2006, 27,384 Cambodians
have migrated to Korea for work, however there has been a significant increase in migration to
Korea since 2010.

Other destination countries
The MOU between the Kingdom of Cambodia and the Japan International Training Cooperation
Organization (JITCO) on the management of the sending of Cambodian trainees to Japan has
resulted in 601 Cambodian migrant workers being deployed since 2007. The MOUs with the
State of Qatar and the Government of the State of Kuwait were signed in 2011 and 2009
respectively but, as yet, no Cambodian migrant workers have been sent through these channels.

3.2 Remittances

In 2011, the World Bank estimated that Cambodian migrants sent home US$354 million in
remittances, not including the remittances sent through non-official channels.27 In
comparison, net foreign direct investment (FDI) inflows to Cambodia were US$800 million, and
net overseas development aid (ODA) for Cambodia was US$700 million in the same year.28
Forty per cent of Cambodian migrant workers in Thailand reported that remittances were the
main sources of income for their families, and the money was mainly spent on daily expenses,
health care, and household appliances.29 Women migrants remit on average 20 per cent more
than men migrants.30

There has been limited research and programming on remittances and harnessing these
funds for productive investment and development in Cambodia.

3.3 National regulatory and legal framework
In recent years, the Royal Government of Cambodia has strengthened the framework for labour
migration governance. In August 2011, the Government adopted Sub-Decree No. 190 on the
Management of Sending of Cambodian Workers Abroad through Private Recruitment Agencies.
The Sub-Decree strengthened the regulatory framework for governing labour migration and
protecting migrant workers, and acknowledges the potential impact of migration on poverty
reduction and human resource development.

In 2013, the adoption of eight prakas to support Sub-Decree 190 provided greater clarity to
authorities on their roles and responsibilities. These prakas were drafted and reviewed
through consultation with social partners and civil society organizations, drawing on
extensive inputs from the ILO. Efforts have been made to ensure that the prakas are gender-
sensitive through reviews of draft legislation by UN Women and MOWA.

Eight prakas adopted in February and September 2013;
o Prakas No 045/13 concerning the use of terms outlines the meaning of key terms used

     in Sub-Decree 190.
o Prakas No 047/13 concerning private recruitment agency outlines the requirements

     of a private recruitment agency to be recognised as a legal entity from the MOLVT.
o Prakas No 046/13 concerning the recruitment process and pre-departure orientation

     sets minimum standards for private recruitment agencies in their legal responsibilities to
     migrant workers prior to being sent abroad.
o Prakas No 249 concerning complaint receiving mechanism for migrant workers
     outlines the MOLVT complaints process for migrant workers.
o Prakas No 250 concerning inspection on private recruitment agency outlines the MOLVTs
     standards for inspections.
o Prakas No 251 concerning penalty and reward to the private recruitment agency
     stipulates that private recruitment agencies will be inspected every two years, and that
     they must meet a certain minimum standard in order to continue to operate.
o Prakas No 252 concerning on-site service of the private recruitment agency and
     repatriation outlines the private recruitment agencies responsibilities to migrant workers in
     destination countries and during repatriation processes.
o Prakas No 253 concerning promulgation of minimum standards of job placement
     services abroad contract stipulates all articles that need to be included in the contract
     between the private recruitment agency and Cambodian migrant worker.

To be licensed, a recruitment agency must receive authorisation from the MOLVT as per
Sub-decree No. 190 and prakas No. 47. Together these instruments stipulate that recruitment
agencies must not sub-contract any part of their licence, that they are responsible for migrant
workers pre-departure, during placement abroad, and repatriation, that they must provide pre-
departure training, and have a permanent representative in the destination country for migrant
workers' welfare. Recruitment agencies must sign an agreement with MOLVT, pay a guarantee
deposit of US$100,000, and report on a monthly, quarterly, semesterly and yearly basis. If
recruitment agencies do not satisfy these requirements, MOLVT has the power to refuse to

  20
 

issue a license, issue a warning to the recruitment agency, or discontinue their license. The
number of licensed recruitment agencies increased from 18 in 2008 to 55 in 2014, with
all 55 recruitment agencies reportedly being members of the Association of Cambodian
Recruitment Agencies (ACRA). ACRA was established in 2008 and promotes the orderly and
safe migration of Cambodian migrant workers, and brings together licensed recruitment
agencies into a voluntary industry body.

A number of other laws, sub-decrees and prakas also provide protection to migrant workers:
Sub-decree No. 205 on provision of ordinary passport was passed after the mass exodus of
Cambodian migrant workers from Thailand in June 2014. In Cambodia, the provision of
passports is managed by the MOI and can currently only be obtained from MOI Passport
Departments in Phnom Penh and Battambang. Historically, many Cambodian migrant workers
travel without passports due to the complex process to issue passports and the ease of
border crossing.

 Sub-decree No. 205 on provision of ordinary passport to Khmer worker and student
     stipulates that passports for migrant workers must be paid for by the government, and
     migrant workers must only pay US$4 for the passport photo.

 Inter-ministerial prakas No 2574 on format and procedure for issuance of normal
     passport for Khmer workers to work legally abroad stipulates that migrant workers
     themselves will get their passports at the Passport Department in the office of the MOI in
     Phnom Penh and MOI Provincial Passport Offices Â­ as of July 2014 there was one
     provincial passport office in Battambang.

The Cambodian Law on Suppression of Human Trafficking and Sexual Exploitation and the
Penal Code include provisions that govern the acts of trafficking, exploitative recruitment,
illegal confinement and fraud and forgery (in relation to false identification) by an offender or
attempted offender, committed in Cambodia or on a flight or vessel that flies the Cambodian
flag, in any territory where the perpetrator or victim is a Cambodian citizen. The Cambodian Civil
Code and Sub-decree No. 38 Referring to Contract and Other Liabilities, include provisions for
breach of contract, misrepresentation, voidability of contracts and tortious liability (including
negligence). As such, these two legal instruments could be referred to when a worker has
been exploited or deceived into a contractual situation but does not have the evidence or
inclination to pursue a criminal claim. To date, however, these legal instruments have not been
referred to or utilised to assist with civil claims, and few criminal cases relating to labour
migration have been pursued with only a handful being pursued successfully. The Cambodian
Labour Law applies only to work to be completed in Cambodia and does not apply to work to be
completed abroad.

Improving implementation of the legal and policy framework requires further investment in
the capacity of labour authorities and other departments and stakeholders at the central and
provincial levels. Training on the above prakas by the MOLVT was run in 2014 for all PDOLVT
Directors, Chief of Bureaus and Chairs of the provincial-level National Committees to Counter
Human Trafficking (NCCT). The Royal Government of Cambodia now also has tools for
implementation such as the complaints mechanism, forms and database, and the standardised
Pre-Departure Orientation Curriculum for Thailand and Malaysia, for which a training-of-trainers
course was conducted in November 2014.

  21
 

3.4 Institutional framework
The General Department of Labour, MOLVT is the primary body governing labour migration, in
association with MOFA&IC and MOI. The General Department of Labour has five sub-
departments: (i) labour inspections, (ii) labour disputes, (iii) employment and manpower, (iv)
child labour, and (v) occupational health. According to Prakas No. 218 on Reform of
Organisation and Functioning of Department of Employment and Manpower dated 10
September 2014, the Department of Employment and Manpower is the secretariat of the
General Department of Labour, and is tasked with protection and management of Khmer
workers in Cambodia and overseas. The Department is structured with nine offices responsible
for (i) public relations, (ii) management of alien workers, (iii) monitoring and inspection of alien
workers, (iv) monitoring of Khmer workers, (v) employment and manpower statistics, (vi)
job placement in Cambodia, (vii) job placement office for Malaysia and Arabic Countries, (viii)
job placement office for Thailand, (ix) job placement office for Japan, Singapore and all other
countries.

The Inter-Ministerial Working Group for the Implementation of the MOU with Thailand comprises
the MOLVT, MOI, and MOFA&IC, and meets annually before meeting with the Royal
Government of Thailand to discuss progress of implementation of the MOU between the two
countries.

Coming out of the consultations for the Labour Migration Policy for Cambodia, establishing a
Sub-Committee on Labour Migration under the Inter-Ministerial Committee on Examining
and Preparing the National Employment Policy chaired by MOLVT that will annually review
progress and identify priorities for the upcoming year was discussed.

3.5 International instruments
Cambodia has ratified all eight core ILO Conventions, is a signatory to the UN International
Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of their Families
(1990), and has ratified the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against
Women (CEDAW) (1979), and the Optional Protocol to CEDAW (1999). The Committee on the
Elimination of Discrimination against Women issued General Recommendation No. 26
(December 2008) on women migrant workers, that describes the obligations of State parties to
respect, protect, and fulfil the human rights of women migrant workers.

Cambodia has not ratified ILO Convention No. 97 on the Migration for Employment Convention
(revised 1949), ILO Convention No. 143 on the Migrations in Abusive Conditions and the
Promotion of Equality of Opportunity and Treatment of Migrant Workers Convention (1975). The
Government has not ratified other important migration governance conventions including ILO
Convention No. 189 Domestic Workers Convention (2011), ILO Convention No. 188 on Work
in Fishing, ILO Convention No. 181 on Private Employment Agencies (1997), ILO Protocol on
Forced Labour (2014), and the UN International Convention on the Protection of the Rights of
All Migrant Workers and Members of their Families (1990).

3.6 Regional instruments
Cambodia is a signatory to the ASEAN Declaration on the Protection and Promotion of the
Rights of Migrant Workers, adopted by the Heads of Government in 2007 in Cebu. MOLVT has
been actively involved in the regional discussions on the drafting of a new ASEAN Agreement
on the Protection and Promotion of the Rights of Migrant Workers. Cambodia has adopted
  22
 

the ASEAN Declaration on Strengthening Social Protection adopted by the Heads of
Government in 2013 in Brunei. With the advent of AEC in 2015, MOLVT will strategize with
associations representing workers and employers on how Cambodia can benefit from this
development. In addition, MOLVT will participate in bilateral and regional discussions on,
among other things, skills recognition, data sharing, and social security transfer and portability.

3.7 Nexus between labour migration and trafficking in Cambodia
The nexus between labour migration and human trafficking is globally recognised. According to
ILO estimates in 201231, more women than men are in forced labour, though men are more
likely to be in forced labour exploitation. Women migrants are particularly at risk because of low
levels of education, limited access to formal employment and higher representation in especially
high-risk workplaces, including homes and entertainment venues32. Some efforts to link the
reduction of human trafficking through better governance of migration have been made by
the various institutions of the Royal Cambodian Government, as outlined below.

In September 2012, a Migration Working Group was established under the Secretariat of the
NCCT. The overall purpose of the Group is to "promote and protect the safety, rights, and
interests of migrants in a way that is gender responsive by using a multi-disciplinary and
multi-sectoral approach." The NGO community and international organizations have established
a regular forum to discuss labour migration and trafficking, and coordinate responses.

In October 2014, the Royal Government of the Kingdom of Cambodia and the Royal
Government of the Kingdom of Thailand, renewed the MOU on Bilateral Cooperation for
Eliminating Trafficking in Persons and Protecting Victims of Trafficking first signed in 2003.

4. Economic growth and employment trends

In the decade prior to the 2008 global financial crisis, Cambodia grew at an average economic
annual rate of over 9.1 per cent.33 Since the global financial crisis the economy has recovered
well, growing at an average of seven per cent between 2009 and 2012. This economic
development helped employment rates to grow at 3.6 per cent per year between
1998 and 2008.34 In 2012, 67 per cent of Cambodian workers were employed, with an
unemployment rate of 2.7 per cent.35 While a decade of rapid growth has notably improved
the livelihoods of Cambodian people, with the headcount poverty rate falling from 50.1 per cent
in 2007 to 20.5 per cent in 201136, there is more work to be done to ensure decent and quality
employment for Cambodia's working population, to viably and sustainably reduce poverty.

4.1 Employment by sector in Cambodia
In 2013, agricultural, forestry and fishing workers accounted for the largest share of the total
employed population at 62.9 per cent, followed by 11.9 per cent employed as services and sales
workers and 10.1 per cent as craft and related workers (Graph 2).37 Women workers
outnumbered men workers in these three largest work sectors, whereas men dominated in the
remaining sectors (elementary occupations, professionals, clerical support workers, plant and
machine operators, and managers).38 This data reinforces the link between education and
better employment; women's participation in secondary education is lower than men's (32.1 per
cent of Cambodian men had attended secondary school in 2012, as opposed to 23.9

per cent of women39). Women are therefore more limited in opportunities to enter semi
professional occupations that remain male-dominated and better paid. This is a push factor for
low-skilled women workers to migrate, as they can receive better wages in their lower skilled
professions overseas.

4.2 Informal employment in Cambodia
In 2012, an estimated 81.2 per cent (5.9 million people) of the 7.2 million employed people
aged over 15 in Cambodia, worked in an informal sector enterprise, while 17.7 per cent (1.3
million people) worked in a formal sector enterprise.40 Employment of men and women in the
informal sector was fairly even with women employed in 49.5 per cent of jobs. Men hold a larger
proportion of formal sector jobs at 69.9 per cent.41

The informal sector and informal employment continue to be vulnerable, with workers
unlikely to have access to benefits or social protection programmes, and predominately low
wages more at risk to the effects of economic cycles. The extent of the informal sector is a good
labour market performance indicator, signalling the underutilization of the labour supply in
Cambodia, and another push factor for people migrating overseas for work.

4.3 Unemployment
The extent of unemployment in a country reflects the efficiency and effectiveness of an economy
to absorb its labour force, and of the performance of the labour market. By a broad definition of
unemployment, 42 the estimated unemployment rate43 in 2012 was 2.7 per cent for both men
and women, with more urban-based people unemployed at 3 per cent, and rural-based
people at 2.6 per cent.44 In Cambodia around two per cent of employed people were found in
time-related underemployment,45 with 2.5 per cent of this population male, and 1.6 per cent
female.

The youth (aged 15-24) unemployment rate in 2012 was 3.8 per cent (two per cent men, 1.8
per cent women), with the highest unemployment rate found among those aged 20Â­24 years at
4.5 per cent (4.8 per cent for men, 4.1 per cent for women). In 2012, Cambodian youth
comprised 63 per cent of the total labour force. In order to absorb new job seekers in the labour
force, the Government will need to diversify its economic base, boost the level of economic
growth, and promote domestic and foreign investment. Achieving this will require enhancing
productive work in existing economic activities and adequately training young workers for
employment in emerging sectors.

4.4 ASEAN Economic Community 2015
With AEC coming into effect in 2015, regional integration will enable more mobility of skilled
professionals. The main tools for facilitating labour mobility under the AEC are the MRAs.
MRAs establish the skills or experience relevant professionals need to gain certification and
ultimately, to work abroad. However, seven of the eight occupations currently covered by MRAs
(engineers, nurses, architects, land surveyors, medical and dental practitioners, and
accountants), constitute just one per cent of total employment in Cambodia.46 Moreover, any
mobility of professional workers will disproportionately benefit men, given that men are
represented in far higher numbers within these occupations. Women's equal access to
employment must be addressed in order to ensure that they are able to benefit from AEC.

After the establishment of AEC, the demand for low- or medium-skilled migrant workers will
persist, and may actually increase, as can be seen in Graph 3, which considers the case of
Thailand.

42 Under international standards, the strict definition of unemployment includes those who were searching and were
available for work. A broad definition also includes those who wanted to work.

work additional hours and (iii) having worked (total number of hours actually worked) below a threshold of working
hours.

Thailand's ageing population and falling fertility rates will contribute to labour shortages which
are expected to create a shortfall of some 4.7 million workers by 2020.47 Correspondingly,
the demand for migrant workers is projected to increase over this period, with the greatest
demand being for low- and medium-skilled workers. Given the overrepresentation of women
migrant workers in low-skilled positions, Cambodian women should be supported through this
policy to achieve the economic advantages offered by increased demand.

     Graph 3: Projected demand for migrant workers in Thailand, 2012-21 (millions) 48

As most of Cambodia's migrant workers are low- or medium-skilled, current measures for
the freer mobility of high-skilled workers are likely to have limited impact in the short term.
Between 2015 and 2025, demand is likely to increase rapidly for some skills in the region,
and decrease for others. Growth in low-skilled employment will probably remain strong however
in Cambodia, highlighting the continued importance of ensuring quality standards in basic
education and training, and a focus on skills recognition, social protection and safeguarding the
rights of migrant workers.

4.5 Skills development and recognition
The Cambodia Qualifications Framework (CQF) has been devised, and there has been steady
progress with the development of competency standards and new technical and vocational
qualifications. However, the overall architecture of a functioning technical and vocational
education and training (TVET) system is still in development. At the same time, the ILO
"Towards a Mutual Recognition of Skills (MRS) in Cambodia, Lao PDR and Myanmar"
Project aims to assist in navigating these three countries in the design and implementation
of the mutual recognition of skills mechanisms through policy guidelines and directions. By doing
so, Cambodia will be able to gradually and equitably integrate into the AEC and, in turn, enjoy
the benefits. The project goal is that by March 2015, two skills or competency standards in two
occupations are agreed, developed and adapted in Cambodia through tripartite consultation,

and that appropriate competency-based curriculum and learning materials are developed.49

An ADB Project is also working to support the Government's socio-economic development
programme through provision of an industry-endorsed TVET system (using a Competency
Based Training model) aligned with the basic and middle-level skill requirements of the
formal and informal economies in three industry sectors: mechanics, construction, and business
services / information and communications technology (ICT). The project is expected to
increase the employment-ready and qualified middle-level workforce both in rural and urban
areas. It is expected that there will be at least a 30 per cent increase in the number of employees
holding formal industry endorsed TVET qualifications, and greater employer satisfaction with
employees holding new formal TVET qualifications.50

In addition, a modality is required to assess and recognize the skills of returning migrant workers
so they can find decent jobs in Cambodia and contribute more fully to national development.
This requires the setting up of a national assessment centre, which is also required for full
implementation of the CQF. A benchmarking exercise was also requested so that the CQF may
be compared with the frameworks in other ASEAN countries to ensure complementarity and
mutual skills recognition.

5. Evaluation of the Policy on Labour Migration for Cambodia 2010-2015

In June 2010, the MOLVT launched its first Policy on Labour Migration for Cambodia for
2010-2015. The policy and accompanying action plan were prepared through a series of
consultative workshops with concerned government agencies, workers' and employers'
organizations, international agencies, NGOs and community based organisations (CBOs) in
Cambodia. The policy articulated the main policy challenges for the Royal Government of
Cambodia, and outlined three main objectives which are still relevant in 2015; better governance
of labour migration; protection and empowerment of migrant workers; and harnessing the
potential of labour migration for development. The policy action plan activities were identified as
short term (1-2 years) or medium term (3-5 years), and identified responsible stakeholders in
the realization of these goals.

In 2014, at the first consultation to assess the implementation of the 2010-2015 Policy and to
gather input to support the development of the 2015-2018 Policy, stakeholders used a
system devised by UN Women, to determine if activities from the 2010-2015 Policy on were on
target, progressing, or not on target.

Of the 79 activities in the action plan, most of which are assigned to the MOLVT as the lead
implementing stakeholder, 21.5 per cent were assessed as being on target, 43 per cent were

progressing, and 35.5 per cent were not on target (Graph 4). Of the activities that are on
target and progressing, most are undertaken with the support of international organizations and
NGOs, and funded by the donor community, with notable contributions from USAID, DFAT, SDC
and UN agencies, and numerous civil society organisations that conduct safe migration training.
In terms of the three objectives identified in the Policy, more progress has been seen under
`Governance of Labour Migration' and the `Protection and Empowerment of Migrant Workers',
than under `Harnessing Labour Migration for Development' (Graph 4). As such, implementation
of the Labour Migration Policy for Cambodia 2015-2018 will focus more around harnessing the
development potential of labour migration, as much progress has been made on legislative
development over the last five years.

Some of the gaps in the implementation of the Action Plan may be due to a lack of
ownership beyond the MOLVT and a lack of monitoring and evaluation. After its adoption, there
was limited discussion with stakeholders outside the MOLVT on the Policy and action plan. It is
also clear that the Government, international organizations and donors have put a priority on
combatting exploitation and human trafficking, and therefore there was more support available
to MOLVT and others in conducting activities aimed to address the protection of migrant
workers. Across the countries of origin in ASEAN, with the exception of the Philippines, there
are few examples of policies and programmes to support the return and reintegration of
migrant workers. It is also important to recognize the limited human and financial resources of
the MOLVT to address all aspects of the plan. Recognizing that some issues in labour migration
management lie outside the mandate of the MOLVT, success of the Labour Migration Policy
for Cambodia 2015-2018 will rely on increased and continued cooperation amongst government
departments, and with social partners in Cambodia.

  28
 

6. Objectives of the Labour Migration Policy for Cambodia 2015-2018

Significant progress has been made in recent years on legal and policy framework governing
labour migration, and measures to protect migrant workers, this continues to be a priority for the
Royal Government of Cambodia. However, more can be done to enhance the development
impact of labour migration. This requires enabling safe migration into decent work, as well as
efforts to address the reintegration of migrant workers, the productive use of remittances and
greater engagement with diaspora and returned migrants. These initiatives must be evidence-
based, drawing on sex-disaggregated data collection to measure the positive use of
remittances, the link between skills acquisition and earning potential, and the link between
migration and poverty reduction.

More broadly, this Policy recognizes the need to simultaneously promote quality domestic
employment and skills development for workers into emerging sectors, as well as
streamlining labour migration into national employment and development plans. The in-
development National Employment Policy includes supporting the mobility of workers and
protection of migrant workers under the goal of enhancing labour market governance, as
well as putting employment generation (quantity and quality) at the heart of economic and social
policy-making. Labour migration is also included in the National Strategic Development
Plan 2014-2018, framing emigration as a potential tool to strengthen Cambodia's human
resources, and the Rectangular Strategy Phase III 2013-2018, demonstrating a Government
commitment to promote employment and institute a policy framework so that productive
employment generation and economic development occur in tandem.

One of the areas for improvement identified in the Policy on Labour Migration for Cambodia for
2010-2015 was systematic monitoring and evaluation by an oversight body. In consultations for
the Labour Migration Policy 2015-18, the Government discussed establishing a Sub-Committee
on Labour Migration, with tripartite representation, under the Inter-Ministerial Committee on
Examining and Preparing the National Employment Policy chaired by MOLVT that will annually
review progress and identify priorities for the upcoming year. At the inaugural meeting of this
Sub-Committee, clear operational responsibilities, indicators of progress and means of
verification (using data from different Government departments, social partners and CSOs)
would need to be outlined for the MOLVT, MOI, MOFA&IC and MOWA on the implementation
of this Policy. The activities in the Action Plan have been framed in a way to allow for simpler
verification and reporting of progress.

Overall policy objective:
To develop a comprehensive and effective labour migration governance framework that protects
and empowers women and men throughout the migration cycle, ensures that migration is an
informed choice, and enables a positive and profitable experience for individual workers, their
families and communities, that also contributes to the development of Cambodia. Recognizing
and responding to the distinct needs of migrant workers with respect to their gender, sector,
legal status and other individual characteristics, is central to the Policy and its effective
implementation.

To achieve this overall policy objective, there are three specific objectives; (1) formulation
and implementation of rights-based and gender-sensitive policy and legislation through
social dialogue at all levels; (2) protection and empowerment of men and women migrant
workers regardless of their status through all stages of the migration process; and (3) harnessing
  29
 

labour migration and mobility to enhance social and economic development in Cambodia
recognising that migrant workers are agents of innovation and development.
Section 7 Policy Matrix: Strategic areas, policy goals and action plan sets out the three specific
objectives, areas of implementation, policy goals, and activities to achieve them, responsible
government stakeholders and timeframe to achieve these activities.

The following sections 6.1, 6.2, and 6.3 outline the policy goals under the Policy's 3
specific objectives. The action points to achieve these policy goals can be found in Section
7 Policy Matrix: Strategic areas, policy goals and action plan.

6.1 Governance of labour migration
Since 2011, the MOLVT has initiated a number legislative instruments to strengthen labour
migration governance. These have set up a framework for regulating recruitment practices,
protecting migrant workers and facilitating regular migration. Bilaterally, there has also been
cooperation with the Royal Government of Thailand on the regularisation of irregular migrant
workers. In 2014, the Government responded quickly to the exodus of Cambodian migrant
workers from Thailand by providing employment services, proposing provincial passport offices
and lowering the cost of passports Â­ although the effectiveness of these services was
undermined by the swift return of migrants to Thailand. Following the suspension on sending
domestic workers to Malaysia, several drafts of a MOU with Malaysia have been reviewed with
the goal of reopening this corridor.
It is acknowledged that labour migration is an issue inter-connected with a range of other
policies involving other ministries and stakeholders, and more dialogue and cooperation is
needed to meaningfully implement and enforce protection mechanisms for migrant workers.

6.1.1 Key policy areas in migration governance
Governance of labour migration is divided into three areas of implementation: international
framework, legislative / regulatory framework and institutional framework.

  30
 

International framework
Policy goal 1: International standards and instruments related to labour migration and
migrant workers are reviewed with respect to the Cambodian context and legal framework, and
ratified and implemented in a gender-sensitive manner.

Policy goal 2: The Government contributes to multilateral and regional cooperation on labour
migration, particularly within ASEAN, with a clear vision of how ASEAN regional integration and
the ASEAN Economic Community (AEC) can enhance decent work opportunities for all migrant
workers.

Policy goal 3: In consultation with social partners and civil society organizations, the Government
establishes gender-sensitive, sector specific minimum standards for MOUs with destination
countries as a condition of sending, and key articles for contracts with employers prior to sending
any workers abroad.

Institutional Framework
Policy goal 4: The MOLVT invests in the capacity of the relevant bodies at central and provincial
levels, and takes a leadership role in strengthening inter-ministerial cooperation on labour
migration, including actively contributing to the Migration Working Group of the National
Committee to Counter Human Trafficking.

Legislative/regulatory framework
Policy goal 5: New legislation and regulations are considered only where gaps are identified,
and developed to reflect the specific and distinct needs of women and men migrants through
tripartite consultation. Procedures related to labour migration are streamlined to incentivise
regular migration and protect workers' rights.

Policy goal 6: Sex-disaggregated data is collected and analysed on a regular basis to inform
evidence-based policy that is tailored to and addresses the experiences of women and men
migrant workers.

6.2 Protection and empowerment of women and men migrant workers
Since 2011, the MOLVT has given significant attention to increasing the protection of
migrant workers prior to departure. Prakas No. 47 ensures that private recruitment agencies
must satisfy a range of minimum requirements in order to obtain a license, with prakas No.
250 and 251 instituting regular monitoring processes for private recruitment agencies, and
suspending their license if they fail to comply. Currently, MOLVT is formulating checklists to
outline more specific criteria for inspections of recruitment agencies.

Sub-decree 190, prakas No. 46, and the effective delivery of MOLVT national standardised Pre-
Departure Orientation materials, can ensure that each migrant worker is informed of their
rights at work and workplace practices, culture and tradition in destination countries, financial
literacy, health awareness, and how to access rights both at home and abroad. The prakas
ensures that trainers from recruitment agencies must be certified, and that migrant workers
receive a pre-departure orientation certificate as proof of completion as a pre- requisite to
migration. The MOLVT has conducted training-of-trainers for pre-departure training, and will
monitor its quality and assess its effectiveness.

In January 2014, the MOLVT opened a Migrant Worker Resource Centre (MRC) at the
Department of Employment and Manpower in Phnom Penh. Amongst its other functions, this
  31
 

MRC receives migrant worker grievances as per the complaints mechanism outlined in
prakas No. 249. Complaints received to date relate to conditions prior to departure (for example,
costs or delays in deployment) or while abroad (for example, pay or work conditions). In the
coming years, institutional capacity will be built for migrant workers to lodge complaints
through any PDOLVTs and have conciliation meetings held at the provincial level. Given
reports of abusive, exploitative, fraudulent practices, or breaches of contracts held by
Cambodian migrant workers, it is timely that in November 2014 the MOLVT is formulating a
prakas on use of private recruitment agencies guarantee deposit as a mechanism to be able to
compensate victims.

Whilst prakas No. 252 outlines private recruitment agencies' responsibilities to migrant workers
in destination countries, more work is needed to ensure the protection of migrant workers
abroad. The Government has not yet appointed labour attachÃ©s in key destination countries,
although MOLVT is in the process of deploying a labour councillor to the Republic of Korea. The
consular mandate needs to include vetting employers and working conditions before allowing
migrant workers to be recruited, and working closely with authorities and other service
providers to ensure the protection of Cambodian nationals.

6.2.1 Key policy areas in protection and empowerment of migrant workers
Protection and empowerment of migrant workers is divided into two areas of implementation:
supervision of recruitment and placement, and support services.

Supervision of recruitment and placement
Policy goal 7: The Government monitors and enforces protection mechanisms in the recruitment
and placement of migrant workers, including institutionalising inspection of private recruitment
agencies, the delivery of pre-departure training, and regulating the costs of migration, including
brokerage fees.

Policy goal 8: Unlicensed brokers or agents, or licensed recruitment agencies linked to
exploitative or unscrupulous practices, are targeted with appropriate sanctions to reduce
irregular migration and reduce the vulnerability of migrant workers.

Support Services
Policy goal 9: Government consular services are established or enhanced in major
destination countries to provide effective assistance to men and women migrant workers
regardless of their status, including shelter, legal, labour dispute, social protection and
repatriation facilities.

Policy goal 10: Migrants' access to justice is facilitated through implementing the complaints
mechanism in an effective, gender-sensitive and timely manner. In the event of a crime, judicial
processes are initiated to ensure an adequate penalty, and a deterrent to others.

Policy goal 11: The Government facilitates migrants' access to vocational training programs to
develop and recognize the skills of migrant workers as a measure to enhance protection and
earning potential. Training programmes and skills recognition systems are developed for women
and men in consultation with employers and governments of destination countries, according to
labour market needs, in specific occupations and sectors.

  32
 

Policy goal 12: The Government cooperates with local leaders, social partners and civil society
organizations to provide accurate and up-to-date information on safe migration and rights at
work in major migrant-sending communities and in transit hubs.

Policy goal 13: Feasibility studies are conducted by the Government on further protection
mechanisms for men and women migrant workers such as the revolving credit and loan funds,
and migrant welfare funds to assist men and women migrant workers with migration.

6.3 Harnessing labour migration for development
Since 2010, inclusion of international labour migration policy into national development and
employment plans has increased, as has acknowledged that domestic policy needs to cater to
the large young working age population.

The National Strategic Development Plan 2014-2018, categorises emigration as an issue for
the National Committee for Population and Development (NCPD) to work on in association with
other line ministries and agencies, to strengthen its human resources for integrating population-
related issues into the development planning processes at all levels for planners and policy
makers. The in-development National Employment Policy aims to put employment generation
(quantity and quality) at the heart of economic and social policy- making, focusing on young
women and men and considering labour migration amongst other aspects. The National Policy
of Cambodian Youth Development in association with the National Youth Action Plan 2014Â­
2018, seeks to provide alternatives to migration, while the Millennium Development Goals
Acceleration Process includes providing employment and training services as alternatives to
migration and options for returning migrants. The Rectangular Strategy Phase III 2013-2018
demonstrates a strong Government commitment to promoting employment as a central part of
their medium-term development strategy and institute a policy framework such that productive
employment generation and economic development occur in tandem.

These policies and initiatives, however, have yet to be transformed into operational programmes
and services that either provide adequate alternatives to migration for certain parts of the
population, enhance the development impact of migration, or that will benefit returning migrant
workers in their economic and social reintegration.

6.3.1 Key policy areas in migration and development
Harnessing labour migration for development is divided into three areas of implementation:
migration in the National Development Agenda, migrants' remittances and investments, and
return and reintegration.

Migration in the National Development Agenda
Policy goal 14: Labour migration continues to be included within national development and
sectorial plans to recognize and maximise the development potential of migration for Cambodia,
and ensure coherent development planning.

Migrants' remittances and investments
Policy goal 15: The Government works with financial institutions in Cambodia and
destination countries to enable access to safe, efficient and cheaper remittance and financial
services for migrant workers. The impact of remittances on development is enhanced through
support services provided to migrants and their families, including gender-sensitive financial
literacy training, a broader range of financial services and products, and dialogue and tools for

  33
 
diaspora engagement.
Return and Reintegration
Policy goal 16: Productive return and reintegration of women and men migrant workers is
enabled through evidence-based policy, and strengthened service provision for social and
economic reintegration, including employment services, skills development and recognition,
enterprise development training, and investment programmes.
Policy goal 17: The social cost of migration is mitigated through specific programmes, including
through the provision of support to the families and children of migrant workers.
