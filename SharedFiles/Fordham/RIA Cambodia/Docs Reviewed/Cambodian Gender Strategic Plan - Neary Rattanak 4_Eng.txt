FOREWORD

Neary Rattanak IV is the five-year strategic plan (2014 Â­ 2018) for Gender Equality and the Empowerment of Women in
Cambodia. On behalf of the Cambodian Women Machinery (the Ministry of Women's Affairs and the Cambodian National
Council for Women) I would like to inform that:

In accordance with the current situation in the country and Phase III of the Rectangular Strategy for Growth,
Employment, Equity and Efficiency, the Ministry of Women's Affairs, in partnership with relevant ministries/institutions
and other partners, has developed the strategic plan Neary Rattanak IV to continue the government's efforts to promote
gender equality and the empowerment of women in Cambodia. The strategic plan has been prepared based on the
lessons learned and results of the implementation of Neary Rattanak III as well as the findings and recommendations
of the Cambodia Gender Assessment 2014. It reflects the vision of the Ministry of Women's Affairs (MoWA) for the next
five years with a particular focus on MoWA's long-term institutional strengthening and capacity development to fulfill our
mandate as strategic gender policy advisor and facilitator with line ministries at national and sub-national levels. Neary
Rattanak IV aims to support the reform process of the Ministry of Women's Affairs to move from project-based activities to
a Program-Based Approach, and promoting MoWA's role in providing effective gender analysis, institutional advocacy and
policy advice across the entire Government.

Neary Rattanak IV is a policy instrument to foster gender mainstreaming in key government reform programs such as
Decentralization and Deconcentration Program, Public Administration Reform, Public Financial Management Reform,
Legal and Judicial Reform, and Land Reform. It also reflects the contributions and linkages to the implementation of
national plans, policies and targets including the Cambodian Millennium Development Goals; the National Strategic
Development Plan 2014-2018; the Education for All Policy; the Second National Action Plan to Prevent Violence Against
Women; the National Action Plan on the Suppression of Human Trafficking and Sexual Exploitation; the Social Security
Policy; the MDG Acceleration Framework; the sectoral Gender Mainstreaming Action Plans; and the annual plans of the
Cambodian National Council for Women. Moreover, Neary Rattanak IV responds to priority development issues in
Cambodia, and incorporates regional and international cooperation agreements and commitments such as the CEDAW
Concluding Observations.

The development of this strategic plan included a comprehensive consultation, cooperation, and partnership process
with line ministries/institutions and other stakeholders at both the national and sub-national levels, including develop-
ment partners and NGOs. This process resulted in a broad-based and inclusive strategy which addresses the challenges for
achieving gender equality and the full participation of women in Cambodia's society.

It is my sincere hope that line ministries, other government institutions, civil society organizations and development
partners will continue their support and valued cooperation for the successful implementation of the Neary Rattanak IV,
for the benefit of our nation as a whole.

BACKGROUND

The Ministry of Women's Affairs (MoWA) and the Cambodian National Council for Women (CNCW) are the national
machinery for the promotion of gender equality and women's empowerment in Cambodia. MoWA acts as a catalyst and
advocate to encourage public institutions, civil society and the private sector to integrate gender equality into their
policies and programs, and as a coordinator and facilitator for gender mainstreaming across government. It is responsible
for monitoring and evaluating policies and programs to assess their contribution to achieving the Government's goals in
promoting gender equality and the empowerment of women.
In 1999, MoWA prepared and implemented its first five-year strategic plan, called "Neary Rattanak". In 2013, MoWA in
partnership with line ministries and institutions at national and sub-national level reviewed the effectiveness and
efficiency of the implementation of the strategic plans "Neary Rattanak I-III" and developed "Neary Rattanak IV". This was
considered an important part of the Royal Government of Cambodia's (RGC) Rectangular Strategy of its fourth mandate,
along with the National Strategic Development Plan (NSDP) 2014-2018.
Neary Rattanak IV will launch MoWA's transition from project-based activities to a program-based approach (PBA), and
from implementation and service delivery to promoting social accountability for women and providing high-level strategic
policy advisory services. With Cambodia's rapid economic development and a shift from least-developed to lower-middle-
income country status, comes rising inequalities and vulnerabilities of under-served groups and areas. Thus, the plan will
also mainstream issues related to vulnerability and disability, and include a sub-regional perspective, based on sub-
regionally disaggregated gender analysis by sector, to better understand where the most severe gaps are across the
country and target them with appropriate measures.
This fourth five-year strategic plan (Neary Rattanak IV) is designed to provide detailed action plans to support the transition
from project-based to program-based approaches, with a strong emphasis on building capacity of institutions across
government for gender equality.
This plan outlines the vision, mission, guiding principles, key goals, objectives and strategies to reach those goals, which
are designed as thematic programs. Underpinning the thematic programs is a comprehensive overarching Institutional
Strengthening and Capacity Development Framework that guides the approach and the process.
Neary Rattanak IV incorporates the key gender themes from the "Rectangular Strategy for Growth, Employment, Equity
and Efficiency, Phase III"1, the NSDP 2014-2018, the Draft Cambodia Millennium Development Goals (CMDG) Report 2013,
and the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW) Concluding Observations
on the fourth and fifth periodic report of Cambodia2.

KEY ACHIEVEMENTS AND CHALLENGES

In relation to promoting gender equality and women's empowerment, "the backbone of economy and society," in the last
legislature of the national assembly, the RGC implemented Neary Rattanak III 2009-2013. This focused on increasing
opportunities at all levels: economic, social and governance. Gender was mainstreamed into the NSDP Update 2009-2013
with some specific target indicators for monitoring the implementation.

During the implementation of Neary Rattanak III, the RGC through MoWA, line ministries and development partners
achieved remarkable success in contributing to gender-responsive laws, policies and programs at national and sub-
national levels; the promotion of women's economic empowerment, including climate change and environment
management; the elimination of all forms of discrimination against women; the improvement of health and nutrition for
women and girls; the prevention of the HIV epidemic; the promotion of women's and girls' participation in education,
together with the promotion of social morality, women and family values; and the promotion of women's participation in
decision-making at all levels.

Women's Economic Empowerment

Cambodia is making good progress in women's economic empowerment. The RGC's long-term goal is to create jobs and
ensure improved working conditions3, which directly contributes to economic empowerment of women. The Gender
Inequality Index (GII) 2013 indicated that female participation in the labour market is 79.2 percent. In the Global Gender
Gap Index 2013 for economic participation, Cambodia scores quite high for labour force participation, but lower for
professional and technical workers4. The growth of trade, services and manufacturing, agriculture, hotels and
accommodation has increased jobs for women Â­ accounting for 89 percent of all women's employment5. There have been
increased employment opportunities for both women and men, and a decrease in vulnerable employment. The poverty
rate dropped from 29.90 percent in 2008 to 19.80 percent in 20116.

The RGC has made regular efforts to provide economic opportunities for women and has enabled women to generate
incomes for their families. These efforts include establishing Women's Development Centres (WDC) in 13 provinces, which
play an important role in delivering business development services to women. Approximately 13,102 women have received
vocational skills at WDCs. The Cambodian Women Entrepreneurs' Association (CWEA) was established in 2012, comprising
150 members, for developing women's businesses and strengthening the voices of women entrepreneurs in the private
sector7.

The Millennium Development Goal Acceleration Framework (MAF) was developed to accelerate achieving CMDG Goal 3,
focusing on women's economic empowerment and mobilizing public institutions, the private sector and development
partners. Its three strategies are: 1) Strengthening vocational skills for women based on market demand; 2) Developing
micro, small and medium enterprises; and 3) Improving livelihoods in rural areas.

Despite great efforts and progress, there are challenges to be addressed:

 The wage employment sector offers many opportunities for women, but the benefits are curtailed by low wages, poor
     working conditions, a gap between demand and supply of available jobs, and ASEAN economic integration.

 There is lot of potential for women to create and expand micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs), but they have
     limited access to business-related services and resources, including finance. Most women-owned enterprises are
     informal and concentrated in less productive sectors.

 As income-earning opportunities are high in the domestic labour market and MSME sector, many women migrate from
     rural to urban areas, and to neighbouring countries, to find jobs. Generally, they face more risks than men, including
     physical abuse.

 There is limited effective cooperation between line institutions in delivering technical and vocational training and
     interventions to enable women to access job opportunities, or to promote women's entrepreneurship.

 There is a lack of cooperation between the public and private sectors to increase services of WDCs.

Education for Women and Girls and Attitudinal Change

Gender disparity in education has reduced at all levels, with more scholarships for poor students, especially girls, more
schools at the sub-national level, and more girls' dormitories.

Since 2008, gender has been mainstreamed in policies and plans in education and vocational training, including the
Education Strategic Plan (2009-2013); the Curriculum Development Master Plan (2010-2014); the Teacher Development
Master Plan (2010-2014); the Master Plan for Capacity Development in the Education Sector (2011-2015); the Gender
Mainstreaming Strategic Plan (2011-2015); the Policy on Human Resources in the Education Sector (2012); the Teacher
Policy (2013); the National Policy of Cambodia Youth Development (2011); the MoLVT Strategic Plan (2009-2013); and the
Social Marketing Strategy: Strategy for Gender Equity in TVET (2014-2018).

These laws, policies and plans have contributed to the promotion of gender equality in education and vocational training
through improved physical infrastructure, better access and opportunities for girls to education and training, better social
attitudes and favourable conditions for the participation of women at all levels and in all sectors. At the preschool level,
there have been gradual increases in the enrolment of both boys and girls over the last five years8, contributing to
children's increased levels of education and confidence in primary education and beyond. At the primary and secondary
levels, the enrolment of girls is equal to that of boys9. In 2012, more girls than boys enrolled in lower secondary education10.
In higher education, the proportion of female students has been increasing steadily, from 33 percent in 2008 to 37.6
percent in 201111. The proportion of girls in technical and vocational training has also increased.

The National Committee for Upholding Social Morality, Women's and Khmer Family Values has been implementing its
multi-sectoral work plan aimed at reducing anti-social behaviour and increasing mutual respect, particularly for women
and girls, ensuring harmony and happiness within the family and in the society as a whole. All relevant institutions at
national and sub-national levels have been working together to reduce violations of human rights and the rights of the
child, all forms of violence, human trafficking, theft/robberies and drug use.

Major challenges to expanding education and training opportunities for girls and women include:

 Negative social attitudes towards girls' education, illiteracy and low levels of parents' education, child marriage,
     domestic violence and opportunity costs of education.

 Child protection in schools remains limited, particularly for girls to travel safely to and from school, to be free from
     violence at school, and in terms of access to sanitation facilities.

 Community and parent engagement in school activities and children's education remains weak.

 Rapid industrial growth, ASEAN economic integration in 2015, together with the increasing level of materialism in
     society will drive the demand for skilled workers and will push young girls and boys into the labour market.

 Children of women who suffer gender-based violence12, girls with disabilities13, lesbian girls and trans-gender people14
     have higher school absence and drop-out rates, due to their personal and family situation and/or bullying from peers.

Gender and Health

The maternal mortality rate (MMR) decreased by more than half, from 472 per 100,000 live births in 2005 to 206 per 100,000
live births in 201015. Access to maternal health care also improved steadily over the same five years16. Positive trends
continue due to interventions by the Ministry of Health (MoH), other institutions and partners involved in increasing the
number of health care providers at health centres, education programs and outreach by village health workers.

Stunting reduced from 50 percent in 2000 to 40 percent in 2010. Wasting decreased from 17 percent in 2000 to 8 percent in
2005, and slightly increased to 11 percent in 2010. Underweight rates decreased from 39 percent in 2000 to 28 percent in
201017.

Information on reproductive and sexual health is important for youth to understand their reproductive and sexual rights.
In 2013, the RGC made a commitment to address this issue through the Ministry of Education, Youth and Sport (MoEYS), by
adopting a comprehensive curriculum for youth in primary and secondary education, as well as for those outside school.
The curriculum includes information on reproductive and sexual health in relation to age, gender, gender-based violence,
drugs, life skills and HIV/AIDS.

Remaining challenges include:

 Lack of skilled service providers in remote areas and lack of adequate medicine and modern health equipment in
     health centres. Social, cultural and economic factors all contribute to low levels of awareness, access to information,
     and health care seeking behaviour among women. Poverty and domestic violence compound health issues for
     women and girls.

 Despite the impressive decrease in MMR, there are still significant inequities in pregnant women's access to health
     care, and maternal mortality remains high compared to other countries in the region. Contraceptive prevalence has
     gradually increased however unmet need remains high at 17 percent.18 Non-communicable diseases are emerging as
     a significant concern, and women face a lack of detection and treatment for cervical, ovarian and breast cancers.

 Lack of access to clean water and sanitation has a negative effect on the nutritional status of women.

 There is a 3.4 percent prevalence of blindness among women older than 50 years, compared to 2 percent of men in the
     same of age group19. There is no explanation for the difference between the prevalence of blindness among men and
     women; this requires further study and an expansion of services.

 Social and cultural barriers continue to be obstacles in many countries, including Cambodia, to speaking openly
     about sexual health issues, particularly between mothers and youth.

Gender and HIV

The rate of HIV among men and women aged 15 to 49 years decreased remarkably from 1.7 percent in 1998 to 0.7 percent
in 201420 (projection). This was due to a decrease in new infections through prevention efforts, especially among high-risk
groups, increased coverage of HIV blood tests, treatment with anti-HIV drugs and improved information services and
communication from ministries and stakeholders.

Cambodia achieved the universal goal of access to services for the treatment of women and men, girls and boys, with a rate
of up to 89.5 percent for the needy21. As a result of this achievement, the estimated deaths from AIDS and HIV transmission
from mother to child decreased significantly in recent years.

With the participation of relevant line ministries, the National AIDS Authority prepared a third National Strategic Plan for
Comprehensive and Multi-Sectoral Response to HIV/AIDS (2011-2015), as well as training programs and guidelines on
gender mainstreaming in response to HIV/AIDS. MoWA also prepared a Strategic Plan on Women, the Girl Child and HIV/
AIDS (2008-2012), and training programs on mainstreaming the fight against HIV/AIDS in the process of promoting gender
equality.

Based on the Cambodia Gender Assessment 201422, challenges related to gender and HIV include:

 Heterosexual sex is the main mode of HIV transmission.

 Gendered power relations and social norms (e.g. women's subordinate status and relative lack of power to negotiate
     safer sex) exacerbate women's greater biological susceptibility to infection. Some women and girls are extremely
     vulnerable to physical and sexual violence and rape, which can cause HIV transmission.

 Lack of funding, fears about HIV status and negative attitudes among service providers specializing in AIDS pose
     obstacles to women living with HIV accessing services and information about family planning and infant care.

 Other target groups vulnerable to HIV infection and transmission include female entertainment workers selling sex,
     injecting drug users, women in prison, gay people and youth23. Lack of comprehensive knowledge about HIV, sexual
     conduct and hazardous use of alcohol and drugs, along with gender-based violence, increase the risk of HIV
     transmission among these target groups.

 The national clinical and policy guidelines responding to intimate partner violence and sexual violence are being
     developed, however currently there is no provision of free post-exposure prophylaxis in cases of sexual assault,
     relevant especially to women in most at-risk populations. There is also a lack of legal aid and legal assistance services
     for people living with HIV and most at-risk populations.

Violence Against Women and Girls

According to the 2005 Cambodia Demographic and Health Survey (CDHS), 22 percent of women had experienced physical,
sexual or emotional abuse from their spouse. This is down from 25 percent in 200024.

Cambodia's commune database (CDB) records the number of families25 seeking help from local authorities for domestic
violence. Between 2006 and 2010 the number of families seeking help for domestic violence reduced from 1.63 percent to
0.88 percent26.

Overall, compared to 2005, the 2009 MoWA Follow-up Survey showed fewer people found violence acceptable and more
people recognized that violent acts were illegal27.

The 2010 CDHS reported that the percentage of women who agreed with one reason for wife beating was down from 55
percent in 2005 to 45.7 percent in 201028.

The policy framework to respond to violence against women and girls has improved in recent years. The 2nd National
Action Plan to Prevent Violence Against Women (NAPVAW II) (2014-2018) includes five strategic sectors: 1) primary
prevention; 2) multi-sector protection and legal services; 3) law and policy; 4) capacity building; and 5) monitoring and
evaluation.

In 2010, the RGC issued the Village Commune Safety Policy, containing measures against domestic violence and
trafficking of women and girls.

There is awareness that some women and girls are at increased risk of violence or have particular challenges in
accessing protection and social services. In recent years various research studies have broadened the understanding of
violence against women and girls in Cambodia.

There is a greater focus on developing coordinated multi-sectoral social services and legal support across the country for
women and children victims of violence. However, according to the Cambodia Gender Assessment 2014, there are still a
number of challenges for the RGC to tackle in the years ahead. They include:

 While some data indicates spousal violence is reducing, prevalence remains high. New data is required to fully
     understand the current situation.

 There is little robust data on rape and sexual violence reported by victims, however reporting of rape and sexual
     violence in the family and other settings is high. Gang rape is higher in Cambodia than other countries in the region.

 Sexual harassment is prevalent in the workplace and in communities. Women in some occupations are particularly
     vulnerable.

 Although the policy framework has improved significantly, there is a lack of coordination between authorities,
     investigative resources and skills, and clear guidelines to carry out and enforce the laws. Some laws and policies also
     have gaps.

 Social and legal support services to survivors of violence are not systematically provided, available and accessible for
     all women and girls.

 Women with disabilities are more likely to suffer from family non-partner violence, when compared to women without
     disabilities29. Additionally, stigma, harassment and discrimination is commonly experienced by lesbian, bi-sexual and
     transgender people in Cambodia, yet their experiences of abuse or discrimination are often overlooked or ignored by
     the response systems, their families and communities30. One in five garment factory workers experiences sexual
     harassment in or around the workplace31, and 80 percent of beer promoters experience unwanted sexual touching.
     Data is lacking on other groups of women at increased risk32.

 An undetermined number of women suffered sexual violence33 and/or forced marriage34 during the Khmer Rouge
     regime35.

Women in Public Decision-making and Politics

The RGC has taken several concrete steps to increase gender equality and advance women in decision-making, including
in policies, laws and programs. Special measures have been implemented, resulting in positive increases in the proportion
of women at national and sub-national levels. Obstacles to women's inclusion in public decision-making are well
documented, and solutions have been proposed and agreed by stakeholders.

In 2012, women held 14.75 percent, or nine out of a total of 61 seats in the Senate36. In the National Assembly, female
representation has more than tripled in two decades37. The number of women in Deputy Prime Minister, Minister, Secretary
of State and Under Secretary of State positions increased in 201338. The proportion of women in the judiciary has increased
since 200839. Women comprise 20 percent of Deputy Governors at provincial/capital level, which is above the 2015 CMDG 3

percent in 2014. In district and khan councils, female seats have increased from 12.68 percent in 2009 to 13.85 percent in
2014. The percentage of female commune councillors increased from 15.10 percent in 2007 to 17.78 percent in 201240.

The proportion of women in the civil service increased from 32 percent in 2007 to 37 percent in 201341. Of 27 ministries, 20
reported an increase in the percentage of female personnel, with increases in female representation ranging from 0.27
percent (2008) to 7.9 percent (2013)42. Women's enrolment in the Royal School of Administration (RSA) is increasing,
particularly in pre-service training43.

Despite progress, the following key challenges remain:

 Women in Cambodia remain under-represented in decision-making positions in politics, the public sector, and the
     judiciary.

 Discrimination impacts the ability of women to be promoted.

 Women are concentrated in sectors traditionally associated with women and at lower levels of government.

 At sub-national level, women face a number of challenges to participation in the public and political spheres,
     particularly workplace discrimination.

 The absence of temporary measures to `fast track' the participation of women in public decision-making, such as
     quotas, slows progress.

 The electoral system impacts on opportunities for women in decision-making in several ways: in candidate selection,
     the placement of women on party lists and the absence of quotas for women.

 The responsibility for achieving gender parity in decision-making is largely perceived to remain with women, however
     it is also the responsibility of men.

 Within the civil service, women are concentrated in lower-level positions. Women in management are more likely to
     hold deputy positions.

 There has been no cooperation among stakeholders in the creation of a framework or a joint program for promoting
     women's participation in decision-making.

Gender Mainstreaming in National and Sectoral Policies

A number of laws protecting women's rights have been enacted by the RCG, including: the Criminal Code (2009), the Law
on Administrative Management of the Capital, Provinces, Municipalities, Districts and Khans (2008), and the Law on
Elections of Capital Council, Provincial Council, Municipal Council, District Council and Khan Council (2008).

The NSDP (2014-2018) includes indicators relating to gender equality and puts stronger emphasis on line ministries' roles
in mainstreaming gender in their sectors.

Gender is mainstreamed in national reforms, such as Public Administration Reform (PAR), the Public Financial Management
Reform Program (PFMRP) and the Decentralization and De-concentration Reform Program (D&D), as well as the 10-year
National Program for Sub-National Democratic Development (NP-SNDD) and the 3-year Implementation Plan (IP3).

Notable progress has also been achieved in strengthening the institutional mechanisms to support gender mainstreaming,
including the Technical Working Group on Gender (TWG-G) as part of the Government-Donor Coordination Committee
(GDCC) and Gender Mainstreaming Action Groups (GMAGs) in line ministries. Most line ministries have also developed and
implemented Gender Mainstreaming Action Plans (GMAPs). At the sub-national level, Women and Children Consultative
Committees (WCCC) have been established at capital, provincial, municipality, district and khan levels. They provide
suggestions and recommendations to the council, board of governors, governors and other council committees on issues
related to gender equity and women's and children's issues within the authority, function and duties of the council.

Although there is good progress in mainstreaming gender in policies, programs and mechanisms to support gender
mainstreaming at national and sub-national levels, some challenges still remain:
 There is limited capacity in line ministries and institutions for in-depth gender analysis, advocacy and gender

     mainstreaming.
 There are gaps in the implementation of laws, policies, plans and programs.
 Gender mainstreaming has not yet been integrated into PBA format.
 There is limited coordination between relevant stakeholders.
 Links between technical departments of MoWA and GMAGs of line ministries and other technical working groups

     (TWGs) remain weak.
 There is limited budget for implementing gender-related plans and activities.
 Sectoral policies, as well as policies and programs for gender equality, have not yet fully addressed the needs of

     vulnerable groups of women and girls44.

VISION AND MISSION

VISION

Cambodian women and men have equal rights, with women and girls enjoying personal and physical safety, participating
fully in the whole spectrum of public life and decision-making equally to men and boys, and are economically empowered
to guarantee their self-reliance and the well-being of children and families.
For this to be realized, MoWA's capacity needs to be realigned to meet the changing needs of women and men in society,
and to focus more on upstream programs and policies. MoWA's role will transition to that of policymaker, leading
government partners at both national and sub-national levels in gender mainstreming, by coordinating, planning,
mobilizing resources and implementing transformative initiatives.

MISSION

Close gender gaps and promote gender equality and women's empowerment in all key areas by:
1. Mainstreaming gender in the process of national (Rectangular Strategy, NSDP) and sectoral (line ministry) policy and

     program development, implementation, monitoring and evaluation.
2. Mainstreaming gender in key government reform programs such as SNDD, Public Financial Management (PFM), PAR

     and Judicial Reform, including cross-cutting areas such as climate change and vulnerable groups of women and girls.
3. CoordinatingandmonitoringimplementationofspecificnationalprogramssuchasWomen'sEconomicEmpowerment,

     NAPVAW and women in public decision-making.
4. Scaling up the on-going sectoral gender mainstreaming work and supporting gender-responsive social accountability

     and social protection in services such as education and health, as well as in legal and civic rights.
5. Focusing on broad-based organizational and capacity development for promoting gender equality across government

     agencies and programs.
6. Targeting under-served areas and groups that experience the largest gender-based gaps and disadvantages.

PART III

STRATEGIC FRAMEWORK

The Neary Rattanak IV Strategic Plan includes a core program for institutional strengthening and capacity development
towards gender equality, through gender mainstreaming and women's empowerment in the context of economic growth,
social protection and services, and cross-cutting issues. Thematic areas in Neary Rattanak IV are:

1. Economic Growth
      1.1. Women's Economic Empowerment

2. Access to Social Services and Protection
      2.1. Education of Women and Girls, and Behavioural Change
      2.2. Health, HIV and Nutrition of Women and Girls
      2.3. Legal Protection for Women and Girls

3. Cross-Cutting Issues
      3.1. Women in Public Decision-Making and Politics; Gender Responsive Government Policies and Reform Programs
      3.2. Gender and Climate Change, Green Growth and Disaster Risk Management

4. Institutional Strengthening and Capacity Development toward Gender Equality

1. Economic Growth

1.1. Women's Economic Empowerment

Strategic Analysis

Women's economic empowerment is widely recognized as one the critical foundations for promoting gender equality and
women's empowerment. Women have historically played a critical role in Cambodia's economic development, however
they remain economically disadvantaged, particularly with respect to access and control over economic resources,
opportunities for increasing their skills, decision-making and higher-level employment opportunities. The RGC has
recently approved the Millennium Development Goal Acceleration Framework (MAF), which focuses exclusively on Women's
Economic Empowerment. MoWA subsequently produced an Operational Strategy for Women's Economic Empowerment
(OS-WEE), which provides a roadmap for longer term WEE program implementation.

In the Fifth Legislature of the National Assembly, the RGC will continue to implement economic diversification policies
based on the competitiveness of the Cambodian economy, and link the economy to regional production value chains. It
will pay special attention to increasing rice production and milled rice for export, raising manufacturing and agro-industry
products for export, and furthering the Tourism Development Plan 2011-2020. It will promote entrepreneurship (including
small and medium enterprises) especially among Cambodian nationals, covering how to run a business, investment
options, incentives, consultancies, capital and management and production techniques.

Neary Rattanak IV will focus on women's economic empowerment by developing and implementing a PBA under the
leadership of MoWA, in partnership with development partners and line ministries to support the Women's Economic
Empowerment program through the TWG on Women's Economic Empowerment (TWGG-WEE). The program will involve
various line ministries (including the Ministry of Ministry of Industry, Mines and Energy (MIME), the Ministry of Labour and
Vocational Training (MoLVT), the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries (MAFF), the Ministry of Tourism (MoT), the
Ministry of Commerce (MoC) and others). The private sector, chambers of commerce and civil society organizations will
also be involved. The PBA will be based on mutually agreed principles, actions and targets among these stakeholders, and
the successful outcome will rely on all actors' cooperation and efforts.

MoWA will transition from project implementation and service delivery to catalyst and provider of capacity development
and technical advice on gender mainstreaming in the economic sector. The focus will be on ensuring that relevant line
ministries and economic actors are systematically addressing specific targeted gender gaps in their economic, business
and financial services, and MoWA is able to build line ministries' capacity for gender equality, and support and monitor
their programs. Particular focus will be on MIME, MoLVT, MAFF, MoC, MoT, MIH, and others.

16 NEARY RATTANAK IV 2014-2018
Strategic Objective

Improve women's status in the economy, particularly in formal employment, with increased incomes, livelihoods and
social protection, and equal economic and social rights and opportunities.

Strategies

1. Align Neary Rattanak IV strategy for Women's Economic Empowerment and the Operational Strategy for Women's
      Economic Empowerment (OS-WEE) with the MDG Acceleration Framework (MAF).

2. Mainstream gender in the assessments for human resource development related to ASEAN integration and ensure
      inclusion of vulnerable groups.

3. Innovate models for cooperating with the private sector, particularly in developing `green' social enterprises.
4. Promote the establishment and implementation of the National Employment Policy (NEP) and programs that include

      opportunities for women.
5. Expand women's benefit through improved working conditions, social protection and labour standards.
6. Facilitate women's equal access to the arbitration council for resolving labour disputes.
7. Facilitate women's equal access to vocational training at public, private or NGO facilities.
8. Increase understanding of how to create and strengthen women's formal enterprises.
9. Facilitate women's equal access to business services relevant for MSMEs.
10. Enhance networking capacity of women entrepreneurs.
11. Equip women with skills and competencies to manage their households in a socially and environmentally sustainable

      manner.
12. Ensure women's access to secure financial services.
13. Improve women's economic opportunities so that they have the choice to work, earn income and invest in livelihoods.
14. Promote and address women migrant workers' challenges in the process of developing migration policies and other

      migration programs.
15. Ensure the reduction of migration-related risks for Cambodian women workers.

2. Access to Social Services and Protection

2.1. Education of Women and Girls, and Behavioural Change

Strategic Analysis

The strategy on education complements, and is a necessary pre-requisite for the success of, the above strategy on
economic empowerment. As Cambodia moves towards middle-income status and regional integration, there is an
increasing need to promote equal access to high quality education relevant to the forthcoming needs of the rapidly
changing labour market. The gender gap, particularly in secondary and higher education due to insufficient locally
available education facilities, combined with traditional values that place lower primacy on girls and women, needs to be
addressed.

During the Fifth Legislature, the RGC will further promote implementing the `Education for All' policy, improvement in the
quality and effectiveness of education services, and will further develop the capacity of educational institutions and staff45.
MoWA is expected to provide GMAGs with technical support to analyze remaining gender gaps, advocate for and initiate
change and monitor progress. For example, adult literacy and information, education and communication (IEC) materials
for educating girls and preventing drop-outs have been part of MoWA's work, but they have been integrated into the line

ministries' portfolios successfully over the years. Programmatic interventions would ideally be handled by MoEYS, while
the role of MoWA can be moved to increasing social accountability and raising awareness among women and girls about
their entitlements to services and social protection, and monitoring their access to these services.

MoWA will continue to coordinate with members of the Committee for Upholding Social Morality and Women's and Khmer
Family Values, in the implementation of the committee's multi-sectoral strategic plan aimed at preserving good culture,
including a culture of non-violence, and positive social attitudes towards gender equality.

Strategic Objective

Promote gender equality in education; particularly increase access of women and girls in vulnerable groups to education
services through awareness raising, social accountability measures, scholarships and other financial assistance. Increase
the participation of women in all areas of education service delivery and management and promote gender-responsive
social attitudes.

Strategies

1. Improve technical capacity and commitment of relevant officials on gender mainstreaming in policies, programs and
      planning in the education sector.

2. Increase access to day care and community kindergarten facilities.

3. Coordinate the development and implementation of the National Action Plan for Upholding Social Morality and
      Women's and Khmer Family Values.

4. Promote positive images of empowered women and girls and gender-sensitive role models for men and boys.

5. Conduct research studies on the needs of vulnerable women, including the aging, poor, disabled, ethnic minorities
      and those living with HIV.

6. Promote Sub-national Administration's participation and accountability to provide comprehensive and equitable
      education services.

2.2Health, HIV and Nutrition of Women and Girls

Strategic Analysis

MoWA recognizes that gender inequalities are responsible for most women's health issues and that poor health and HIV/
AIDS delivery systems have a higher negative impact on women than men. There is therefore growing commitment among
stakeholders in the health sector that strategies to improve health delivery and Health Equity Funds should be gender
focused in order to increase their impact on women's lives and achieve gender equality.

During the Fifth Legislature, the RGC will continue implementing and updating the Health Sector Strategic Plan (2008-
2015) to promote sustainable development of the health sector, aimed at improved sanitation, health, nutrition and well-
being of the Cambodian people, particularly the poor and vulnerable (including women and children). MoWA will provide
the MoH GMAG with technical support to analyze remaining gender gaps, and advocate for and initiate changes, where
required. For example, IEC for reproductive health, HIV and malaria have been part of MoWA's work program in the past,
but they should be integrated into the MoH portfolio. Programmatic interventions would ideally be handled by MoH, with
the role of MoWA moving to increasing social accountability and raising awareness among women and girls about their
entitlements to services and social protection, and monitoring their access to these services.

MoWA will continue to work with the National AIDS Authority to promote gender equality in the implementation of the 4th
National Strategic Plan for Comprehensive and Multi-Sectoral Response to HIV/AIDS (2011-2015) and the development and
implementation of the 5th National Strategic Plan (2016-2020).

MoWA will continue to contribute to the development and implementation of the National Strategy on Food Security and
Nutrition (2014-2018).

18 NEARY RATTANAK IV 2014-2018
Strategic Objective

Promote gender equality in the health sector by expanding women's access to information and high quality, affordable
health care, including reproductive, sexual and psychological health, food security and nutrition, and prevention of
communicable diseases such as malaria, HIV and STDs, and non-communicable diseases (eye care, cancer).

Strategies

1. Strengthen capacity and commitment of relevant officials on gender mainstreaming in policies, planning and budget-
     ing in the health sector.

2. Analyze and address gender disparities in the health sector.

3. Analyze and address gender gaps in lagging areas and address them in programs, plans and budgets at the sub-na-
     tional level.

4. Contribute to promoting public awareness raising on reproductive, sexual and psychological health, food security and
     nutrition. Protect and fight against communicable diseases such as malaria, HIV/AIDS and STDs, and non-communica-
     ble diseases such as eye diseases and cancer.

5. Strengthen gender mainstreaming and women's empowerment in health-related national strategic plans and pro-
     grams.

2.3. Legal Protection for Women and Girls

Strategic Analysis

While the legal framework and national strategies for protecting women against gender-based violence (GBV) and
trafficking are in place, significant action needs to be taken all at levels and across a range of different actors to
operationalize them to ensure women and girls are safe from various forms of GBV and trafficking.

Neary Rattanak IV will focus on legal protection for women and girls through the development and implementation of a
PBA under the leadership of MoWA. This will be done in partnership with development partners and line ministries to
support the development and implementation of NAPVAW II, through the TWG-G Sub-Group on GBV. Line ministries to be
involved include the Ministry of Interior (MoI), MoH, the Ministry of Justice (MoJ), MoEYS, the Ministry of Social Affairs,
Veterans and Youth Rehabilitation (MoSVY), MoLVT, the Ministry of Planning (MoP) and others, including development
partners and civil society organizations (CSOs). The PBA will be based on mutually agreed principles, actions and targets
among these stakeholders, and the successful outcome will rely on all actors' cooperation and efforts.

MoWA will play an important role in coordinating and overseeing the implementation of NAPVAW II and the related PBA,
which will involve a range of activities and actors. MoWA will participate in developing and implementing the next National
Plan of Action for the Suppression of Human Trafficking, Smuggling, Labour and Sexual Exploitation (NPA-STSLS), which is led
by MoI. Other gender and legal issues include civil registration, women's awareness of their legal rights and access to
justice.

MoWA's role is that of a facilitating leader, catalyst and coordinator to reverse the entrenched discrimination against
women and to ensure women can enjoy equal civic and legal protection.

Because gender is a cross-cutting issue, it is challenging for MoWA to determine the scope of programs and resources for
implementation, particularly for activities which are related to multiple ministries and institutions. MoWA's role is to
coordinate and monitor overall results of such programs, while implementing their own specific activities. Relevant
ministries and institutions need to ensure that gender-specific activities are incorporated into programs and annual plans,
and to mobilize resources for implementation of those activities.

In the 5th Mandate, the RGC will continue to implement key activities in accordance with the strategy for legal and judicial
reform. MoWA will continue to participate in the implementation process of activities under this reform strategy to
promote gender equality in laws, regulations and policies, as well as to increase the proportion of women in the judicial
structure and justice system.

                                                                                                   NEARY RATTANAK IV 2014-2018 19
Strategic Objective

To reduce all forms of violence against women and girls through effective implementation of the NAPVAW II (2014-2018)
and National Action Plan to Fight Human Trafficking (2014-2018).

Strategies

1. Strengthen gender mainstreaming in laws, regulations and policies and address violence against women, migrants
      and marginalized women and girls.

2. Identify specific measures to address GBV and discrimination against marginalized women and girls in collaboration
      with relevant stakeholders.

3. Coordinate the implementation of NAPVAW II (2014-2018) through TWG-G-GBV under the PBA framework.

4. Develop and use systems for baseline data and monitoring of data related to all forms of GBV.

5. Promote public awareness on laws, regulations and services related to the prevention of GBV, and migration.

6. Increase the number and capacity of MoWA's Judicial Police Officers at both national and sub-national levels to assist
      GBV victims.

7. Strengthen and expand One-Stop Services for victims of GBV.

8. Contribute to the implementation of the National Plan of Action to Fight Human Trafficking, (2014-2018).

9. Contribute to the development and effective implementation of the 3rd and 4th Action Plans to Combat Trafficking in
      Persons in the Greater Mekong Sub-Region (2015-2018).

3. Cross-Cutting Issues

Neary Rattanak IV has recognized women in decision-making, gender mainstreaming, climate change, green growth,
disaster risk management and vulnerable groups as critical cross-cutting issues. The needs of vulnerable groups of women
and girls are integrated and addressed in all key strategic areas and interventions of Neary Rattanak IV.

3.1. Women Public Decision-making and Politics, and Gender Responsive Government
     Policies and Reform Programs

Strategic Analysis

The RGC has recognized that sustainable development and good governance depend on women taking part in all decision-
making processes. The most significant quantitative and qualitative gender gaps are in the areas of political participation
and decision-making, due to deeply entrenched gender biases against women which systematically prevent women from
getting equal access to these opportunities.

In the 5th Mandate, the RGC will focus on promoting women in the public sector through increasing the gender balance in
line ministry management and strengthening women's ability to pursue leadership both at management and technical
levels46.

These priorities could be addressed through active and strategic participation in the processes of SNDD, PAR, the National
Election Committee (NEC), political parties and line ministries.

Strong political backing and high-level advocacy from CNCW would be instrumental in pushing this agenda forward.
Through PAR there is potential to advocate for affirmative action for women in the civil service to be implemented and
monitored. MoWA works with the Ministry of Civil Service (MoCS) to maintain up-to-date statistics on women at all levels
of the civil service, and monitor changes.

CNCW and MoWA can advocate with key stakeholders, including the political parties, for legislating affirmative action and

46 Royal Government of Cambodia (2013) Rectangular Strategy for Growth, Employment, Equity and Efficiency, Phase III.

20 NEARY RATTANAK IV 2014-2018
gender equality commitments in political party laws and policies, especially increasing the number of women candidates
on party lists.

MoWA can supplement the policy demand side with additional supporting measures to increase the quality and quantity
of the supply side, such as technical, leadership and management capacity development for women candidates and civil
servants, women in leadership forums and support networks, and promoting women's access to higher education. MoWA
and the Ministry of Civil Service need to ensure that women participate equally in regular civil service capacity development
programs and opportunities.

MoWA will continue to work with LMs, in particular GMAPs to ensure that gender is mainstreamed throughout on-going
RGC policy and reform programs, and to increase the national budget allocation for gender mainstreaming by targeting
specific and adequate resources at the national machinery, as well as in line ministries, with solid gender-mainstreaming
strategies. MoWA is planning to develop the first National Policy on Gender Equality. This, in conjunction with successful
integration of gender equality measures at the reform level, will create an enabling environment and pave the way for
successful mainstreaming at the sectoral level.

MoWA coordinates with PAR/MoCS and line ministries to ensure all programs, legislation and guidelines related to PAR are
gender responsive. Capacity is needed on gender mainstreaming into public administration and public services of MoWA,
MoCS, RSA and line ministries.

The NP-SNDD is an important vehicle for increasing women's participation in decision-making at sub-national level, as
there is a strong gender-mainstreaming component to it. Through the NP-SNDD there is potential for quantitative and
qualitative increases in women's leadership and decision-making at local levels. This can be done through technical
support, capacity building and promoting networking among women leaders at sub-national levels across regions.

The RGC will continue to implement the PFMRP aimed at improving the efficiency and effectiveness of Cambodia's public
financial management system according to international standards. MoWA and the Ministry of Economy and Finance (MEF)
will promote gender-responsive budgeting by encouraging all government agencies to consider the resource implications
of mainstreaming gender into their on-going programs, and ensure that this total allocation is requested from MEF.

In stage two of the PFMRP, MoWA and GMAGs will monitor to ensure that gender equality measures are included in all line
ministries' annual plans and budgets.

Strategic Objective

Promote gender equality in decision-making at all levels and mainstream gender in policies, plans, sectoral programs and
key reform programs of RGC.

Strategies

1. Increase the proportion of women participating in the civil service.

2. Strengthen the capacity and ability of women civil servants and women in decision-making to fulfil their roles and
      responsibilities.

3. Increase the proportion of women in political positions.

4. Update and disseminate the Cambodia Gender Assessment and ensure that national statistical systems are gender-
      responsive.

5. Strengthen gender-responsive national and sectoral strategies.

6. Cooperate in mainstreaming gender into Implementation Plan of NP-NSDD.

7. Ensure that policies, plans, programs, legal regulations and processes related to PAR are gender-responsive.

8. Cooperate with line ministries to ensure they receive national budget for gender mainstreaming through the PFMRP.

9. Promote women's access to and control over land rights through gender mainstreaming in the land reform program.

3.2 Gender and Climate Change, Green Growth and Disaster Management
Strategic Analysis

Programmes related to climate change reflect the new development agenda for the Royal Government of Cambodia, as
well as gender mainstreaming in climate change programmes. The National Climate Change Committee, which includes
MoWA as member, will seek a deeper understanding of how to address the gender impact of climate change.
The Ministry of Environment, the National Climate Change Committee, and the National Council for Green Growth have
developed the Cambodia Climate Change Strategic Plan (CCCSP) 2014-2028, the National Policy on Green Growth and
National Strategic Plan on Green Growth 2013-2030. In the process of implementing these policy frameworks, more
attention should be paid to gender mainstreaming. MoWA in collaboration with the Secretariat of the Committee for
Climate Change is promoting gender equality and women's empowerment in all relevant aspects including the National
Council for Green Growth.
MoWA has developed Strategic Plan on Gender and Climate Change to contribute to the development and implementation
of gender responsive policies related to climate change. This is not a stand-alone strategy but is cross-cutting and has been
integrated into the implementation processes of the Cambodia Climate Change Strategic Plan as well as sectoral climate
change strategic plans of relevant Ministries.
MoWA will continue to participate actively in the National Committee for Disaster Management in the implementation of
National Action Plan and Strategy for Disaster Risk Reduction 2014-2018.

Strategic Objective

Promote gender equality in processes and policy implementation related to climate change, green growth and disaster
risk management within line ministries and institutions at national and sub-national levels, to reduce the impacts on
women and vulnerable women, and to contribute to and benefit from green growth.

Strategies

1. Strengthen the capacity and support of senior officials and technical staff in gender mainstreaming in the climate
      change, green growth and disaster risk management program.

2. Mainstream gender considerations in the development processes and implementation of policy, programs and
      strategies on climate change, green growth and disaster risk management.

3. Ensure equal participation of women, and particularly vulnerable women, in coordination processes and advocacy
      on climate change at international, national and sub-national levels for women's interests.

4. Reduce the impacts of climate change and disasters on women.
5. Increase women's participation in green growth activities.
6. Create new innovative schemes and activities to address gender issues in climate change, green growth and disaster

      risk management which are tested and proposed to line ministries for integration into regular on-going programs.

4. Institutional Strengthening and Capacity Development
    towards Gender Equality

Strategic Analysis

Program-based approaches are the Government's preferred tool for implementing sector strategies and core reforms.
PBAs are regarded as the optimal mechanism to promote national ownership of development programs, and thus are the
official mechanism of aid effectiveness in Cambodia, to ensure coherent programing of resources, strengthen national
capacities and systems, and most importantly, deliver development results more efficiently and effectively. At the third
meeting of the Council for the Development of Cambodia (CDC) in June 2010, the RGC and its development partners
endorsed and agreed to move forward with the PBA model in order to maximize the combined impact of domestic
resources and external development assistance. A key component of a PBA is a comprehensive policy framework with
government leadership and coordination of all partners mobilized around the policy framework as a minimum condition.
Examples of such policy frameworks include the NP-SNDD, PFMRP, the Education Strategic Plan and the second Health
Sector Support Program (HSSP II).

Gender was identified as one of the key thematic areas to be used for PBA in Cambodia, as well as one of the three cross-
cutting pillars for national development. In 2012, MoWA established the PBA Committee and Secretariat (PBA C/S). MoWA
currently has two `sub-PBAs' underway covering Women's Economic Empowerment and Gender Based Violence (NAPVAW).
A PBA for gender equality requires MoWA to take the technical and political lead on facilitating and coordinating analysis
and advocacy and ensuring that gender is mainstreamed across government processes. This will see a progressive
reduction in MoWA's involvement in implementation of smaller service-delivery and awareness-creation projects at the
community level, other than as innovative experimental pilot activities (such as action research on emerging issues) to be
scaled up by the appropriate line ministries. It will progressively re-orient its efforts towards broader dimensions of gender
mainstreaming - research, policy development, monitoring and evaluation, coordination and capacity building. This in
turn requires strengthening MoWA's current capacity for gender mainstreaming and coordination and for taking a lead role
in advocacy across government. A stronger MoWA would provide stakeholders with an authoritative source on gender
mainstreaming and gender issues in Cambodia and would reduce the need for line ministries and development partners
to support diverse small initiatives through other ministries and agencies.

The UN CEDAW Committee recommended that an assessment be done to examine the national machinery for the
advancement of women and related institutions, such as the TWG-G and GMAGs, and links to other key entities (e.g. other
TWGs, MEF, MoP, CDC), and to provide recommendations for improvement.

A MoWA capacity assessment was carried out in 2010, however it only covered staff in MoWA at the central level. The big-
gest challenge in the coming years will be advocating for gender-responsive action across government (other key im-
plementing line ministries and secretariats of inter-ministerial councils) as well as at the sub-national level, as functions
and financial resources are devolved to the sub-national level. Increased attention to assessing the capacity development
needs of the Provincial Department of Women's Affairs (PDWA), District Office of Women's Affairs (DOWA) and commune
level staff is also very important.

A capacity development strategy has been developed, with particular emphasis on strengthening MoWA's capacity to
mainstream gender in key sectors, including strengthening the capacity of technical departments to support and monitor
gender mainstreaming efforts; developing capacity for transitioning from a project-based to a program-based
approach to gender equality; and strengthening PDWA and DOWA capacity to effectively engage in and support gender-
responsive sub-national planning, budgeting, monitoring and social accountability processes.

This core program will be progressive and on-going and will provide tailor-made capacity development services to
the necessary stakeholders, both within and outside of MoWA, according to their functions and roles in the government-
wide gender mainstreaming process.

Strategic Objective

To strengthen the institutional structure and capacity to promote gender equality through PBA and good governance,
which includes vulnerable groups of women and girls47.

FINANCIAL RESOURCES

The implementation of Neary Rattanak IV will be based mainly on financial support from the government and development
partners.

The total cost of implementation is estimated at USD 31,100,000. As gender is cross-cutting across government agenda,
this estimation does not include sectoral gender responsive programs.

Estimated costs broken down by thematic area are as follows:

MONITORING AND EVALUATION

Annual Work Plan

Based on NRIV, MoWA in partnership with line Ministries/institutions and development partners will develop annual work
plans in accordance with its mandate, roles and responsibilities. This will be done through TWG-G, CNCW and other
stakeholders with the Department of Planning and Statistics as the Secretariat. The preparation and review of the annual
work plan will be done at the beginning and end of each year throughout the 5-year period based on NR4, and other
relevant policies and programmes. MoWA will play the role of facilitator in this process through annual meetings to reflect
on the results of the year and plan for the future.

Monitoring and Follow-up

Based on the indicators in this strategic plan, annual work plan and report, and in partnership with relevant Ministries/
institutions, MoWA will review the medium and long-term progress of NRIV.

MoWA, CNCW, and TWG-G will coordinate the preparation of the progress report on promotion of gender equality and
gender mainstreaming to share with line Ministries, relevant institutions at national and sub-national levels as well as
development partners. Monitoring and follow-up of the progress on implementing Neary Rattanak IV will be integrated in
the report.

Evaluation

To monitor the effectiveness and efficiency of the implementation of Neary Rattanak IV, MoWA and its partners will carry
out a mid-term evaluation and a national congress. All relevant stakeholders will participate in evaluating the achievements
and propose future directions for the remaining period.

A national congress to evaluate the overall achievements and impact of the plan will be held at the end of the five years,
with all key stakeholders. By updating the Cambodia Gender Assessment, key achievements in the different areas can be
verified and other targets will be reviewed against the national indicators related to gender equality and the empowerment
of women.

MoWA will develop a single consistent national monitoring framework, which outlines the roles of MoWA, the National
Institute of Statistics (NIS) and line ministries. Given the multi-sectoral nature of gender issues, monitoring and evaluation
will be the responsibility of all implementing institutions involved. MoWA has a coordination and oversight role, while line
ministries, NIS and other research institutions will be critical partners in data collection. Neary Rattanak IV contributes to
achieving and following up key national indicators in the NSDP as shown below.

The following set of indicators will be used to assess progress towards achieving the objectives under each thematic area.
