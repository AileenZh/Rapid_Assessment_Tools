         animals, but it is something

 fundamental to our survival and growth
as a nation, that cuts across all sectors and

                                                                              several International Conventions, including the
                                                                              three United Nations Conventions, which emerged
                                                                              from the 1992 Rio Earth Summit on Biological Di-
versity; Combating Desertification; and Climate Change. These instruments have been instrumental in Na-
mibia's efforts to realign our policies and laws, incorporating international best practices in order to effectively
deal with the challenges and constraints related to the proper management of the environment in our country.

The succesful compilation and launch of this National Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plan (2013-2022) is
further demonstration of our Government's commitment to the sustainable management of unique biodiversity
and ecosystems. It is a continuation of the good work done as part of the first National Biodiversity Strategy
and Action Plan, which was implemented from 2001 to 2010.

The healthy state of our biodiversity is a valuable comparative advantage for Namibia, with the potential to
provide immeasurable economic benefits for our people and our country. At present, Namibia's entire At-
lantic coastline of 1500 kilometers is protected under our framework of proclaimed National Parks. Moreo-
ver, Namibia is home to other environmental conservation initiatives, including four Ramsar Wetland Sites of
international importance, a 12,000 square kilometer Marine Protected Area, and part of the world's largest
Trans-frontier Conservation Area (TFCA) ­ the Kavango Zambezi TFCA, which was proclaimed in 2012. Na-
mibia also possesses the largest free-roaming population of black rhino as well as the largest population of
cheetahs in the world.

We are pleased that environmental conservation is now an established form of land use in Namibia. In addi-
tion to our National Parks, 79 communal conservancies covering almost 19 per cent of the country's total land
surface area, have been registered. Forthermore, approximately 15 percent of freehold land is dedicated to
wildlife management. Ongoing research indicates that the populations of different wildlife species in Namibia
will continue to increase in the coming years.

Conscious of the critical importance of biodiversity to the socio-economic development of our country, the fo-
cus of this Strategy goes beyond the conservation of protected areas and wildlife. Biodiversity and the benefits
that can be derived from intact and healthy ecosystems such as clean air and water and productive soils, are
the basis of all life. For this reason alone, the importance of biodiversity cannot be over-emphasised.

                                                            i
In Namibia, we have always considered the three objectives of the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD)
as being mutually reinforcing. We recognize sustainable use of natural resources as the key factor linking con-
servation to fair and equitable benefit-sharing. We will, therefore, continue to advance this approach through
the implementation period of this Strategy so that biodiversity is placed at the centre of our development ef-
forts to achieve sustainable economic growth and poverty alleviation in our country, especially in rural areas.
Namibia's recent ratification of the Nagoya Protocol on Access and Benefit- Sharing signifies our desire to
accelerate the fair and equitable distribution of benefits that can be derived from biodiversity, especially by our
local communities.
This approach is in line with our drive to achieve our long-term national development strategy, Vision 2030. We
are confident that the effective implementation of this National Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plan (2013-
2022) will contribute greatly towards the revitalisation of our biodiversity and the realisation of our Vision 2030.

                                                                            world's largest Trans-frontier Conservation Area; an
increase in the number of conservancies from 15 to 79 and the proclamation of 32 community forests; and
the continued recovery of wildlife and fishing stocks based on an innovative policy framework and system of
quotas and permits. The beneficiation of our communities has been at the heart of this process.

It is the task of NBSAP2 to build on these achievements and tackle the threats and challenges we are facing.
These have been well documented in the thorough review process undertaken on NBSAP1, and I am con-
fident that NBSAP2 will lead to the continued and enhanced health of our ecosystems as well as improved
living conditions among our rural populations. This is encapsulated in our vision for NBSAP2 for "Namibia's
biodiversity to be healthy and resilient to threats, with its conservation and sustainable use as key drivers of
poverty alleviation and equitable economic growth, particularly in rural areas".

The consultative process to develop NBSAP2 has been comprehensive and has guided the need to align NB-
SAP2 closely with the CBD Strategic Plan and the associated Aichi Targets. Each of the five Strategic Goals
of the CBD is of very high relevance to Namibia and we have refined the Aichi Targets based on our national
priorities and threats into 17 targets which we consider to be specific, measurable and attainable. This ap-
proach will also streamline our reporting the Convention and provide clear evidence of our national contribu-
tion towards the achievement of the Aichi Targets.

NBSAP2 is thus our main vehicle to spearhead action on all matters of biodiversity from the management
of all ecosystems and species, to biosystematics and biosafety, to access and benefit-sharing. With this in
mind, implementation will be closely coordinated between all stakeholders and I look forward to us partnering
together to achieve the important goal of NBSAP2.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Biodiversity and the natural environment are of critical importance to Namibia. Natural resource-based sec-
tors including mining, fisheries, agriculture and tourism are the basis of the Namibian economy, and around 70
per cent of Namibia's population is directly dependent on the natural resource base for income; food; medici-
nal and health needs; fuel and shelter. This situation demands that biodiversity, and the ecosystem services it
provides, are maintained and enhanced as far as possible for sustainable development. Namibia recognizes
the essential role of National Biodiversity Strategies and Action Plans (NBSAPs) in this regard.

Namibia implemented its first NBSAP during the period 2001-2010. This was internationally recognised as
being one of the best first generation NBSAPs, and it provided a strong foundation for the sustainable man-
agement and use of biodiversity in the country. In 2012, Namibia set about the process to develop NBSAP2 to
build upon this foundation and to directly tackle the threats and challenges it is facing in this area.

Namibia's NBSAP2 will cover the period 2013-2022, and its vision is for "Namibia's biodiversity to be healthy
and resilient to threats, and for the conservation and sustainable use of biodiversity to be key drivers of pov-
erty alleviation and equitable economic growth, particularly in rural areas."

The Paper was developed in a highly participatory manner involving over 400 stakeholders from international
experts to on-the-ground managers of natural resources. The consultative process included a detailed review
of Namibia's first NBSAP (2001-2010) which provided valuable lessons and guidance for the formulation of
NBSAP2.

One of the key lessons learned was the need for NBSAP2 to be more focused, and this is reflected in a more
concise structure. Based on national and regional prioritization exercises, the five strategic goals of the CBD
Strategic Plan were considered highly relevant to Namibia, and these provide the overarching framework
for NBSAP2. The 20 Aichi Targets were reduced to 17 national targets which are considered to be specific,
measurable, attainable, relevant and are time-bound to Namibia. In this way, NBSAP2 is both closely aligned
to the CBD Strategic Plan and Aichi Targets (2011-2020), and targeting Namibia's unique priorities and circum-
stances. The Strategic Goals and Targets of NBSAP2 are presented in the table below:

NBSAP2 Goals and Targets                                                            Lead GRN

 biodiversity and can identify important reasons for biodiversity conservation      MET
2. By 2018, biodiversity values and prioritized ecosystem services are quantified,
 monitored and mainstreamed to support national and sectoral policy-making,         MET and MoF
 planning, budgeting and decision-making frameworks
3. By 2018, selected incentives for biodiversity conservation and sustainable use
 are in place and applied, and the most harmful subsidies are identified and their
 phase out is initiated

Strategic Goal B: Reduce direct pressures on biodiversity and promote the

sustainable use of biological resources                                             MLR / MET

4. By 2022, the rate of loss and degradation of natural habitats outside protected

 implementation of this strategy and action plan                            MoF

Strategic initiatives were also formulated to guide actions that will ultimately lead Namibia on a path towards
the achievement of its 17 targets. There are 38 such strategic initiatives, each with associated activities
identified during the NBSAP2 consultative process. The activities also have designated lead agencies and
indicators to allow for improved monitoring.

The implementation of NBSAP2 will be coordinated by the Multi-Lateral Environmental Agreements Divi-
sion within the Ministry of Environment and Tourism (MET) with the full participation and guidance of the
cross-sectoral NBSAP2 steering committee. Independent mid-term and final evaluations of NBSAP2 will be
undertaken to ensure that the status of biodiversity in Namibia is effectively tracked and so that Namibia's
contribution towards the achievement of the CBD Strategic Plan (2011-2020) and the Aichi Targets can be
effectively measured.

1. INTRODUCTION

1.1 Background Information

Namibia is one of the few countries in the world that includes a clause in its constitution targeting the sustain-
able management of biodiversity. Article 95(L) of the 1990 Constitution requires the State to take measures to
promote and maintain the welfare of the people including "the maintenance of ecosystems, essential ecologi-
cal processes and biological diversity of Namibia and utilization of living natural resources on a sustainable
basis for the benefit of all Namibians, both present and future..."
The three objectives of the CBD, for which this document is the key national level implementing instrument,
correspond closely with Article 95 (L), as they seek to promote:
 1.The conservation of biological diversity;
 2.The sustainable use of its components; and
 3.The equitable sharing of benefits arising out of the utilization of genetic resources.
Recognizing the importance of these objectives to its national circumstances, Namibia signed the CBD in
1992 and ratified it in1997. Namibia developed a first NBSAP in 2001, which covered the period 2001-2010.
This sought to implement the three objectives of the CBD in an integrated manner and was internationally
recognized as one of the best first-generation NBSAPs.
In 2012, Namibia embarked on a process to review implementation of NBSAP1 and to develop a second
generation NBSAP that is aligned with the latest national and global trends (in particular, the Strategic Plan
for Biodiversity 2011-2020 including the Aichi Targets; decision x/2) and good practices, and that can address
critical challenges and capitalize on existing areas of comparative advantage in the areas of natural resource
management and environmental protection.

1.2 Namibia's Biological Diversity

Namibia's biodiversity is shaped by a diverse range of factors including climate, topography, geology and
human influences. As the most arid country south of the Sahara, lack of rainfall and the high variability of
rainfall are perhaps the leading influences on biodiversity. Namibia is characterized by a steep south-west to
north-east rainfall gradient. Annual rainfall can be as low as 10mm in the south-west and west, while it aver-
ages around 600mm in the north-eastern areas (Mendelsohn et al 2003). A reverse gradient exists in terms
of seasonal and daily temperature variations, which are low in the north and north-east and high in the west
and south-west.

                                                           1
As a result, the greatest overall terrestrial species diversity is found in the more tropical areas of north-eastern
Namibia, while areas of high endemism are mainly concentrated in the arid and semi-arid west, central and
southern parts of the country.

1.2.1 Diversity of Ecosystems
Namibia is classified into four terrestrial biomes (Desert; Nama and Succulent Karoo; Acacia Savanna; and
Broad-leafed Savanna), and two aquatic biomes (Coastal Marine; and Wetlands). Each biome is affected to
different extents by land uses such as rangeland farming, agriculture, wildlife production, tourism and recrea-
tion, mining and urban development. Namibia's variable environmental conditions have also shaped a large
diversity of vegetation zones, which have been divided into 29 units. In general, palaeotropical floral elements
are found in the north, cold-temperate elements in the south, and transitional elements between the two. The
vegetation zones and biomes are shown in detail in Figure 1 below.

1.2.2 Species Diversity
As an arid country, Namibia has a relatively low number of species compared to countries with wetter climates.
However, it possesses a high level of endemism, with approximately 20% of described species classified as
endemic. Endemism is particularly high in plants, invertebrates, reptiles and frogs in Namibia while it is rela-
tively low for mammals, birds and fish (see Table 2 below).

1.3 National and Global Biodiversity Perspective

Namibia is one of the few dryland countries in the world with internationally recognized biodiversity hotspots.
The most significant of these is the Tsau //Khaeb (Sperrgebiet) National Park, situated in the Succulent Karoo
floral kingdom in Southern Namibia. The second hotspot is the rugged Namib Escarpment, which is part of
Africa's great western escarpment, and an area of particularly high endemism.

 Vegetation types   56 different vegetation types
 Plants             About 1,050 species representing 25% of the entire flora of Namibia on just 3% of
                    the country's land surface
 Frogs              16 species
 Reptiles           100 species
 Birds              35 coastal and marine species,
                    60 wetland species
                    120 terrestrial species
 Mammals            80 terrestrial species
                    38 marine species including an estimated 600,000 cape fur seals or 50% of the
                    world's population
 Insects and other  Great number of insects and other invertebrates, of which probably 90% are not
 invertebrates      described by science
                    A Marine Protected Area covering 13 offshore islands and islets

Table 3: Biodiversity of selected taxonomic groups found in the Tsau //Khaeb National Park (MET 2010).

Some sites of national and global significance in Namibia include its:
 · Twenty Protected Areas, which cover hugely varied ecosystems and some 17% of the country's land

          mass including the entire 1500km coastline
 · Two Transfrontier Conservation Areas (TFCAs) ­ Ai-/Ais / Richtersveld TFCA, and the Kavango Zam-

          bezi TFCA (the world's largest TFCA)
 · Four Ramsar Wetland Sites of International Importance ­ Etosha Pan, Walvis Bay Lagoon, Sandwich

          Harbour and the Orange River Mouth. All of these sites are located within protected areas.
 · Nineteen Important Bird Areas (IBAs), 12 of which are located in the coastal zone or on off-shore is-

          lands
 · Forty Important Plant Areas (IPAs), spread across the country.

1.4 Biodiversity Conservation and Sustainable Use for Poverty Alleviation
in Namibia

Biodiversity and the natural environment are of critical importance to Namibia. Natural resource-based sec-
tors including mining, fisheries, agriculture and tourism are the basis of the Namibian economy, and around
70% of Namibia's population is directly dependent on the natural resource base for income; food; medicinal
and health needs; fuel and shelter. This situation demands that biodiversity, and the ecosystem services it
provides, are maintained and enhanced as far as possible for sustainable development.

The tourism industry, of which National Parks are considered the bedrock, is recognized as the fastest grow-
ing sector of the Namibian economy. Travel and tourism was estimated to have accounted for 20.5% of GDP
in 2011 (directly and indirectly) (WTTC 2012), and it is a key industry in Namibia linking economic development
with poverty alleviation and biodiversity conservation with national parks promoted as engines of growth in the
rural areas. This is facilitated by engaging local communities in the management of parks and the sustainable
use of natural resources through the granting of tourism and hunting concessions to local communities, usu-
ally in partnership with private sector investors.

Conservation has emerged as an increasingly viable land use in Namibia, particularly since rights to the con-
ditional use of wildlife were devolved to local communities through conservancies in 1996. It was estimated in

                    4
2012 that conservancies employed around 900 people permanently and 3,500 on a temporary basis, with over
N$50 million being generated by conservancies in 2011 (MET 2012b), mainly through trophy hunting, accom-
modation establishments, and the harvesting and sale of natural resource products and crafts.
The CBNRM Programme is the only example in Namibia in which the linkages between biodiversity and pov-
erty alleviation are systematically measured by collecting periodic data on returns and employment through
tourism establishments and activities, trophy hunting, wildlife meat harvesting, medicinal plant collection, and
non-timber forest products (NTFPs) amongst others. Although CBNRM covers only some 18 per cent of Na-
mibia's landmass, it gives a clear indication of the role biodiversity can play in poverty alleviation in the rural
areas.
The CBNRM Programme has also highlighted the linkages between biodiversity management and gender.
Women have been included in biodiversity governance structures and as the main day-to-day managers of
biodiversity, women are most affected by biodiversity loss and degradation. For this reason they are a key
target group of NBSAP2.
Overall, 42% of Namibia's landmass was under some form of conservation management in 2012 including
through private game parks and nature reserves, tourism concessions, conservancies and community for-
ests. One of the main objectives for NBSAP2 is to ensure that the different conservation land uses are drivers
of poverty alleviation and contribute to ecosystem resilience in rural areas.

2. METHODOLOGY TO DEVELOP NBSAP 2

2.1 Institutional Framework

As focal point to the CBD, the Ministry of Environment and Tourism (MET), through the Department of Envi-
ronmental Affairs (DEA), coordinated the elaboration of NBSAP2 during the period March 2012 to December
2013.

A National NBSAP2 Steering Committee was established and convened for the first time in May 2012. The
first meeting of the NBSAP2 Steering Committee deliberated on the review process for NBSAP1 and on the
best way to elaborate Namibia's 2nd NBSAP. The Committee was originally established to oversee the formu-
lation of NBSAP2 but its mandate has since been extended so that it also coordinates the implementation of
NBSAP2, including its monitoring and evaluation.

2.2 Promoting Participation and Consultation

In line with the guidance of the CBD Conference of Parties decisions IX/8 and X/2, widespread participation
has been promoted in the process to develop NBSAP21. Government ministries; local and regional govern-
ment authorities; the scientific community; non-governmental organisations (NGOs) and community-based
organisations (CBOs); indigenous and local communities; donor agencies; and the private sector were all
closely involved in the NBSAP2 development process. In total, about 400 stakeholders were engaged in the
national and regional level consultative process. Individual interviews were also undertaken with key relevant
stakeholders2.
The roadmap towards developing NBSAP2, highlighting the major milestone events, is presented in the dia-
gram below:

Figure 4: Roadmap followed to develop Namibia's NBSAP2.

Two national level workshops were held in March and July 2012 to review implementation of NBSAP1 and
to provide preliminary inputs to the content and formulation of NBSAP2. The workshops also introduced the
Strategic Plan of the CBD (2011-2020) and the Aichi Targets to the participants who were asked to assess and
prioritize these targets in terms of their relevance to Namibia's national circumstances and to identify prelimi-
nary activities per each target as considered appropriate.

                                 Some Lessons Learned from NBSAP1

 Namibia's first NBSAP1 was internationally recognised as being one of the best first generation NBSAPs. It
 covered 10 Strategic Themes which in turn encompassed 55 strategic aims and 242 activity-based targets.
 The review of NBSAP1 indicated that some 80 per cent of these targets were at least partially achieved.
 NBSAP2 sets about building on areas that were under-achieved but still considered priorities as well as
 identifying new priority areas for action. Some further key lessons to guide the formulation of NBSAP2 are
 highlighted below:

1CoP Decision IX/8 calls on Parties to "engage indigenous and local communities and all relevant sectors and stakehold-
ers" in biodiversity planning and implementation. CoP Decision X/2 calls on Parties to "Enable participation at all levels
to foster the full and effective contributions of women, indigenous and local communities, civic-society organizations, the
private sector and stakeholders from all other sectors in the full implementation of the objectives of the Convention and
the Strategic Plan".

                                                            7
 · Mobilisation of Resources: The NBSAP was an important instrument for channelling resources
          into priority biodiversity areas with a number of donor-funded projects particularly targeting specific
          priority NBSAP areas such as coastal conservation, the CBNRM Programme and the management
          of protected areas.

 · Coordinating framework for NBSAP1: The coordination framework for the implementation and
          monitoring and evaluation of NBSAP1, while initially strong and effective, fell away after the end of
          the donor-funded National Biodiversity Programme in 2005.

 · Scope of NBSAP1: NBSAP1 was well-designed and very ambitious in scope, with equal considera-
          tion given to each of the 3 objectives of the Convention. However, it was arguably over-ambitious and
          NBSAP2 needs to be more focused and outcome-oriented.

 · Capacity for effective implementation of NBSAP1: This was insufficient and is yet to be ad-
          equately addressed in a number of areas including biosystematics, biotechnology and environmental
          monitoring.

 · Low awareness levels of NBSAP1: Awareness of NBSAP1 was low, including among key imple-
          menting partners; regional and local stakeholders; and the general public. NBSAP1 was not ac-
          companied by a Communication, Education and Public Awareness (CEPA) Strategy, which was an
          impediment to effective implementation.

 · Working Groups: The voluntary working groups tasked to formulate and implement specific aspects
          of NBSAP1 had mixed success. Some such as the Namibia Biotechnology Alliance, the Wetlands
          Working Group and the Alien Invasive Species Working Group delivered substantive outputs, how-
          ever almost all failed to last for the duration of NBSAP1. The strong focus on individuals, high rates
          of staff turnover and their voluntary nature tended to reduce their long term effectiveness.

 · Coordination and management of cross-cutting issues: The coordination of areas such as wet-
          lands, mountain ecosystems and biosystematics was a key challenge in NBSAP1 and needs to be
          targeted and improved through NBSAP2

.

Figure 5: Summary of key lessons from the review of NBSAP1.

A regional consultation process was undertaken to raise awareness of NBSAPs in general at local level, to
establish the status quo of existing biodiversity initiatives in the regions and to determine regional priorities
and possible interventions in the development and implementation of the NBSAP2. The relevance of the Aichi
targets to local circumstances was also assessed in each region. The regional consultative process, which
comprised of 5 two-day workshops held to cover regional clusters, was undertaken during October and No-
vember 2012.

A final National Consultative Workshop was held from the 26-27th February 2013 to present the findings from
the regional consultative process, and to secure final inputs from the participants into the content of NBSAP2.
High level technical stakeholders, parliamentarians and traditional authorities were among the key groups
targeted by this workshop. The workshop was quickly followed by a high level segment in which the draft NB-
SAP2 was presented to the Permanent Secretaries of relevant ministries and the Chief Executive Officers of
relevant parastatals and private sector institutions for their awareness and preliminary approval.

Lastly, a comprehensive internal and external peer review was undertaken on the document. The external
peer review was conducted during a regional workshop organized by the NBSAP 2.0 Mainstreaming Biodiver-
sity and Development Project from 8-12 July in Uganda.

2.3 Aligning NBSAP2 with the CBD Strategic Plan and Aichi Targets

Based on the results of the outcomes of the national and regional prioritization exercises, it was decided to
closely align NBSAP2 with the CBD Strategic Plan and Aichi Targets (2011-2020). The national and regional
workshops each revealed that the five strategic goals are of high importance to Namibia, while the twenty
Aichi Targets were also considered relevant for Namibia, though some were refined to better suit Namibia's
circumstances. These alterations are presented in Annex 2.

                9
Figure 6: Outcome of prioritization exercises undertaken on the 20 Aichi Targets in each of Namibia's 13 regions

From the figure 6 it is clear that Strategic Goals A on mainstreaming (targets 1-4); D on benefits (targets 14-
16); and E on participatory planning, knowledge management and capacity building were considered most
important. Over 50 per cent of Namibia's 13 regions prior to new demarcations considered all of the 20 Aichi
Targets as being highly relevant to their region, with the exception of targets 5, 6 and 103. This is explained by
the fact that these targets make specific reference to forests, fisheries and marine ecosystems, which do not
feature in most of Namibia's regions.

3This issue of coral reefs was considered of releatively low importance to Namibia, however climate change is recognized
as a key threat to biodiversity needing to be addressed.

3. OVERVIEW OF NBSAP2

3.1 Structure

The vision of NBSAP2 is for "Namibia's biodiversity to be healthy and resilient to threats, and the con-
servation and sustainable use are key drivers of poverty alleviation and equitable economic growth,
particularly in rural areas".
NBSAP2 has five key strategic objectives, each of which has a number of targets to be achieved by the end of
the timeframe of the NBSAP2. There are a total of 17 targets, closely aligned to the Aichi Targets, and each
with one or more key performance indicators.
In line with the CBD Strategic Plan (2011-2020), the strategic goals of NBSAP2 are to:
 1. Address the underlying causes of biodiversity loss by mainstreaming biodiversity across government

          and society
 2. Reduce the direct pressures on biodiversity and promote the sustainable use of biological resources
 3. Improve the status of biodiversity by safeguarding ecosystems, species and genetic diversity
 4. Enhance the benefits to all from biodiversity and ecosystem services
 5. Enhance implementation of NBSAP2 through participatory planning, knowledge management and

          capacity building

Strategic initiatives are intended to guide actions that will ultimately lead Namibia on a path towards the
achievement of these targets. There are 38 such strategic initiatives, each with associated activities identified
during the NBSAP2 consultative process. These activities are described as indicative to allow for flexibility,
and are not intended to be prescriptive. Other sectoral activities and initiatives contributing to the strategic
initiatives and targets are also likely to be developed over the course of the lifespan of NBSAP2.

3.2 Roles and Responsibilities

As the main custodians of Namibia's land and marine resources, the four main natural resources manage-
ment-related ministries ­ MET; Ministry of Agriculture, Water and Forestry; Ministry of Lands and Resettle-
ment; Ministry of Fisheries and Marine Resources ­ will be the lead implementers of NBSAP2.

                                                           11
The other main implementing Ministries include:
 · Ministry of Youth, National Service, Sport and Culture (MYNSSC) for biosystematics; environmental

          education functions; for identifying and managing heritage sites; and for mobilising the youth into bio-
          diversity conservation.
 · Ministry of Mines and Energy in the areas of mining regulation and sustainable energy.
 · Ministry of Regional and Local Government, Housing and Rural Development for coordinating rural
          development.
 · Ministry of Education for integration of biodiversity issues within curricula and for biodiversity-related
          research and science.

Namibia has been one of the most successful countries in Africa in attracting funding for biodiversity-related

projects through the Global Environment Facility (GEF) and also benefits from excellent bilateral coopera-

tion in the area of biodiversity management with a number of countries. These projects typically play an

important role in providing catalytic funding for innovative interventions relating to biodiversity and will di-

rectly contribute to the implementation of NBSAP2. A list of the most significant projects and their areas of

intervention is below:

Table 5: The crucial role of Namibia's supporting projects.

Other important supporting agencies for mainstreaming and implementation of biodiversity-related initiatives
include the tertiary institutions as the generators and purveyors of scientific knowledge; CSOs and donor
agencies as on-the-ground implementers and often pilot practitioners of good practices; the Ministry of Infor-
mation, Communication and Technology and the media for dissemination of information; and cross-sectoral
bodies such as the NBSAP2 steering committee, the Indigenous Plants Taskforce Team, the Namibia Envi-
ronmental Education Network (NEEN) and the Sustainable Development Advisory Council which can convey
the importance of biodiversity to different sectors and facilitate improved coordination of activities.

The Role of CSOs
A number of CSOs are highly active on-the-ground in Namibia, working closely with communities on a
wide variety of environmental issues. CSOs thus have a very important role to play in the implementation
of NBSAP2 in areas such as awareness raising; capacity building for good practices; support to participa-
tory governance and decision-making; research and development; and value addition to natural resources.
Among the most prominent CSOs for biodiversity management are the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF),
Desert Research Foundation of Namibia (DRFN), Namibia Nature Foundation (NNF), Integrated Rural De-
velopment and Nature Conservation (IRDNC), Centre for Research, Information, Action Africa (CRIAA),
and the umbrella body - Namibian Association of CBNRM Support Organizations (NACSO).

A key target group of NBSAP2 is those institutions and stakeholders which are not typically directly respon-
sible for biodiversity management but which have important planning functions or undertake activities which
impact heavily on the environment. In Namibia, of particular importance in this regard, are the:

Office of the Prime Minister (OPM): for integrating biodiversity into the strategic plans of all relevant line
ministries.

Ministry of Finance (MoF): for allocating appropriate funds for biodiversity-related activities and for integrat-
ing these activities in longer term financial planning and budgeting frameworks.

                                                             13
National Planning Commission (NPC): for the integration of biodiversity-related activities into national plan-
ning frameworks (also Namibia's main instruments for poverty reduction) and donor-funded programmes.

Parliamentarians: for mobilizing political will and support towards implementation of NBSAP2. Parliamen-
tarians can play a particularly strong role towards biodiversity management through supportive law-making,
budgetary allocations, oversight, promoting international cooperation and awareness raising.

Traditional Authorities: for the promotion of biodiversity conservation on communal lands and for regulating
access to traditional knowledge.

Regional Councils and Local Authorities: Regional councils for planning in Namibia's political regions, and
Local Authorities for environmentally-friendly approaches to critical urban functions impacting on biodiversity
such as waste management, transport, housing, water and sanitation provision.

Private Sector: The private sector has an essential role to play, both in investing in biodiversity-related op-
portunities and in promoting sustainable consumption and production. The Namibia Chamber of Commerce
and Industry, Chamber of Mines and commercial banks are obvious targets as are companies promoting value
addition to natural resources and Namibia's various tourism associations. Namibia's large number of private
game reserves, as well as the investment by many private companies in low-impact, high quality eco-tourism,
also represent key elements of biodiversity conservation and sustainable use in Namibia. It is estimated that
almost four per cent of Namibia's landmass is used as private game parks and nature reserves (MET 2013).

3.3 Key Priorities of NBSAP2

NBSAP2 has been formulated to capitalize on its comparative advantage in terms of biodiversity status and
potential and to channel efforts and resources into tackling the threats to biodiversity it is facing. The following
key priorities for NBSAP2 are:

3.3.1 Mainstreaming Biodiversity
The need to mainstream biodiversity at all levels of government and society is recognized as a cornerstone of
NBSAP2 (see mainstreaming strategy in section 1 of Action Plan).

3.3.2 Improving Communication of Biodiversity-Related Issues
Low levels of awareness of biodiversity were identified as a critical challenge during the NBSAP2 consultative
process. A CEPA Strategy was thus developed to promote behavioural change and for mainstreaming the im-
portance of biodiversity among the Namibian population, (see the summarised CEPA strategy under section
1.1 of Action Plan, full version is available on www.met.gov.na)

3.3.3 Addressing Critical Threats to Biodiversity
NBSAP2 is geared towards tackling the critical threats to biodiversity that Namibia is facing. These threats can
undermine the economic and social development of the country. It is a strategic priority of NBSAP2 to address
these threats in a holistic manner through a range of measures and mechanisms. The most critical threats to
biodiversity in Namibia are highlighted in Table 8 below6.

6 These threats are not listed in order of severity.

                                                      14
Unsustainable Water Uses Mainly through large scale irrigation (particularly in North-Eastern

 Regions), pollution (in and adjacent to urban areas), damming and over-

 abstraction of groundwater

Expansion of urban areas Leading to increasing demand for resources and services, and increasing

and increasing           types and volumes of waste and pollution

industrialization

Threats and impacts of   Mainly through increased variability drought and flood events; shifts in 

Climate Changevegetation types and species distribution; and effects on vulnerable

 ecosystems such as the Benguela Current Large Marine Ecosystem

Rapid expansion of Mining Expansion of mining and prospecting especially in ecologically sensitive

and Prospecting          areas (including off-shore) and through habitat loss and destruction;

 infrastructural development; increased demand for water and electricity; 

 and the long term impacts of contaminated waste

Unsustainable Land       Leading to soil erosion, land degradation, deforestation and bush

Management Practices     encroachment

Uncontrolled bush fires  In 2011, uncontrolled fires destroyed and damaged around 370,000

 hectares of vegetation. Bush fires are also a major threat to national parks 

 such as Etosha, Namib Naukluft and those in the north-east.

Alien Invasive Species   Lead to species loss and ecosystem simplification and breakdown

Illegal harvesting and   Leads to loss of biological diversity and loss of income arising from

trade of wildlife and forest inequitable benefit sharing from wildlife, forest and plant resources

and plant resources

Human Wildlife Conflict  Increases damages to community livelihoods in terms of crop destruction, 

 water point damage and livestock mortalities and even threats to

 human life

Table 6: Critical threats to biodiversity in Namibia.

3.3.4 Contributing to National Development Objectives
The conservation of biodiversity is prominently addressed in Namibia's long-term development strategy - Vi-
sion 2030 - with a dedicated Chapter on the Sustainable Utilisation of Natural Resources and Environmental
Sustainability.

A focused 4th National Development Plan (NDP4) is under implementation from 2012-2017. NDP4 has three
main objectives, which include high and sustained economic growth; employment creation; and increased
income equality. Biodiversity, through the nature-based tourism sector is already an important provider of em-
ployment, while the potential for it to contribute further to employment creation and reduced income inequality
through biodiversity-based enterprises is still largely untapped.

NDP4 further focuses on the following sectors for economic growth: agriculture, tourism and manufacturing.
Biodiversity management has an important contribution to make towards these objectives and economic prior-
ity areas. Strategic initiatives in NDP4 to promote conservation agriculture and implement a debushing pro-
gramme are good examples of national commitment to sustainable agriculture and the restoration of degraded
lands, while the maintenance and development of national parks and increased investment in communal
areas are outlined as key strategies under the tourism development sector. Value addition, improved market
access, the establishment of testing centres and beneficiation for local people are considered cornerstones
to increase the contribution of manufacturing to the economy. Each of these areas is highly relevant also for
the development of biotrade in Namibia.

3.3.5 Strengthening the Policy-Making Framework for Biodiversity Management
Namibia has an excellent policy and legislative framework for biodiversity conservation and broader environ-
mental management, however implementation and enforcement of this framework is a challenge. NBSAP2

                                                       15
will target the enhanced implementation of this framework, with particular emphasis on the:
 · Environmental Management Act of 2007 for the improved regulation of activities having a harmful im-

          pact on the environment through EIAs and SEAs.
 · Access and Benefit Sharing Bill of 2012 which is expected to be gazetted in 2014.
 · Protected Areas and Wildlife Management Bill which will provide a legal framework for the mainte-

          nance of ecosystems, essential ecological processes and the biological diversity of Namibia, and the
          utilization of living natural resources on a sustainable basis for the benefit of Namibians, and to pro-
          mote the mutually beneficial co-existence of humans with wildlife.
 · National Rangeland Policy and Strategy of 2012 which seeks to enable rangeland managers to man-
          age their rangelands in such a way so that productivity and biodiversity are restored and maintained.
 · National Climate Change Strategy and Action Plan of 2013 which aims to increase climate change
          resilience and optimize opportunities towards sustainable development.
 · Third National Action Programme to Combat Desertification of 2014 which seeks to reverse and pre-
          vent desertification/ land degradation and to mitigate the effects of drought in affected areas to support
          poverty reduction and environmental sustainability.

3.3.6 Generating Reliable Baseline Information
Baseline information is lacking in a number of critical areas including awareness of biodiversity, the value of
biodiversity and ecosystem services for the economy and society, as well as the extent of bio-physical factors
such as land degradation and biodiversity loss. The establishment of such baseline information is a key NB-
SAP2 priority, particularly during the first four years, so that the status quo on these issues can be established
and subsequent trends can be monitored and positively influenced.

3.3.7 Capitalizing on Synergies with the Rio and other Biodiversity-Related Conventions
Namibia is a Party to the Ramsar Convention on Wetlands of International Importance, the Convention on
Trade in Endangered Species (CITES), the International Treaty on Plant and Genetic Resources (ITPGR), the
World Heritage Convention (WHC) as well as the two other Rio Conventions on Climate Change and Deser-
tification. These Conventions are clearly closely linked and NBSAP2 seeks to integrate the objectives and
actions of these Conventions under its umbrella.

The different national focal points to each Convention were closely engaged in the consultative process
to formulate NBSAP2, which in turn has contributed towards the integration of Convention-specific targets,
objectives and commitments into NBSAP2. This will further create synergies in the monitoring process and
national reporting requirements to each Convention. Examples of thematic areas in which Convention-specific
targets, objectives and commitments have been integrated into NBSAP2 are presented in the diagram below:

Figure 7: Thematic areas for synergies through NBSAP2.

                                                           16
3.3.8 Enhancing Regional Cooperation
Namibia recognizes the critical importance of the transboundary management of natural resources, which is
guided by SADC protocols on energy, tourism, fisheries, watercourses, wildlife and law enforcement, and for-
estry. This is further promoted in NBSAP2, particularly with regard to the improved management of Namibia's
two TFCAs (KAZA and the /Ai-/Ais Richtersveld TFCA); the Benguela Current Large Marine Ecosystem; and
the transboundary river commissions such as OKACOM and the Orange-Senqhu Basin Commission. The
NBSAP2 also seeks to identify new areas of cooperation at the regional level. Although the SADC Regional
Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plan is structured differently to the CBD Strategic Plan and Aichi Targets,
Namibia has sought to align its NBSAP2 with this document and this alignment is represented in Annex 37.
3.3.9 Mainstreaming Gender Considerations
Women are sometimes known as the "invisible" managers and users of natural resources in Namibia. Despite
the fact that they are the main managers of these resources on a daily basis, they often play a limited role
in decision-making processes and in the sharing of benefits from their efforts. Empowerment of women is
however occurring in the natural resources management sector and is being actively promoted through the
CBNRM Programme, and targeted support through funding mechanisms such as the Environmental Invest-
ment Fund and the Small Grants Programme of UNDP.
NBSAP2 promotes the full participation of women in the planning and implementation of biodiversity-related
initiatives as well as in the areas of capacity building; value addition and enterprise development; and benefit-
sharing.

7 The alignment of Namibia's NBSAP2 with the SADC Regional Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plan is presented in
Annex 3.

4. THE NATIONAL BIODIVERSITY STRATEGY

4.1 STRATEGIC GOAL 1: Address the underlying causes of biodiversity loss by main-
streaming biodiversity across government and society

The need to integrate the conservation of biodiversity at all levels of government and society is a cornerstone
of NBSAP2. After participation in the NBSAP 2.0 Project and consulting with the Good Practice Guides Series
of the CBD, Namibia is pursuing a two-phase approach to achieve its mainstreaming vision for a "society in
which biodiversity issues and concerns are the responsibility of all citizens and are recognized by all sectors
of government, private sector and civil society".

The mainstreaming approach emphasizes :
 · Making and communicating the business case for biodiversity with focus on poverty alleviation, with

          the aim to improve understanding among decision and policy-makers and the private sector of the
          linkages between biodiversity, poverty and economic development
 · Integrating biodiversity considerations into national, regional, local and sectoral policies, plans, strate-
          gies and budgets

In order to effectively mainstream biodiversity across government and society and to address the underlying
causes of biodiversity loss, the following elements are considered critical:
 · Improved communication, education and public awareness on issues relating to biodiversity
 · Valuations of ecosystem services to inform decision-making about the values of nature and the in-

          tegration of biodiversity into national and sectoral policy-making, planning, budgeting and decision-
          making frameworks
 · Development of a wide range of economic incentives to promote biodiversity conservation and sus-
          tainable use of natural resources

4.1.1 Target 1: By 2020, at least 75% of surveyed key target groups know the meaning
of biodiversity and can identify important reasons for biodiversity conservation

 Key Performance Indicator: Results of surveys for pre-defined target groups using the Biodiversity
 Barometer Tool

 Strategic Initiative:
 1.1.1 Raise public awareness of the meaning and value of conservation of biodiversity and wise 
  use of biodiversity by target groups

                                                           18
 1.1.2 Promote understanding and clarify values of biodiversity and development of positive
  attitude towards conservation and use of biodiversity

 1.1.3 Raise adequate funding to facilitate communication and dissemination of NBSAP2

 1.1.4 Foster international cooperation and networking to enhance communication of the values
  of biodiversity conservation and sustainable use

 With awareness raising being a strong tool for behavioural change and for mainstreaming the importance
 of biodiversity among the Namibian population, it was considered an important priority to develop a Com-
 munication, Education and Public Awareness (CEPA) strategy for NBSAP28.

 The ultimate goal of the CEPA Strategy is "to achieve a positive change in the behaviour of stakehold-
 ers towards biodiversity, based on effectively demonstrating its value and importance to Namibian
 society". It is further expected that the CEPA Strategy will offer a more structured and integrated approach
 to implementation of environment-related awareness raising in Namibia.

 Of key importance is that identified priority target groups and sectors are reached by the strategic stake-
 holders so that they can implement activities towards the conservation and sustainable utilisation of biodi-
 versity. Priority target groups include technical experts and decision-makers in respective line ministries,
 regional councils, local authorities and traditional authorities; politicians and high level stakeholders; private
 sector players; resource managers on-the-ground; and the youth and women's groups. This will require the
 use of an array of different media and resource material.

 The Division of Environmental Information and Natural Resource Economics within the MET will be the lead
 agency to coordinate implementation of the CEPA Strategy. As Secretariat to the multi-stakeholder Namibia
 Environmental Education Network (NEEN), it is well positioned to fulfil this function.

 The CEPA strategy focuses on five key strategic themes, each with corresponding strategic aims:
 (i) Awareness
 (ii) Education
 (iii) Participation and Implementation
 (iv) Funding
 (v) International Cooperation and Networking

 4.1.2 Target 2: By 2018, biodiversity values and prioritized ecosystem services are
 quantified, monitored and mainstreamed to support national and sectoral policy-
 making, planning, budgeting and decision-making frameworks

 Key Performance Indicators:
 · SEA regulations gazetted
 · Integration of biodiversity issues within NDP5
 · Integration of biodiversity into sectoral, regional and local plans and respective budgetary
 allocations

Strategic Initiatives:
 1.2.1 Contextualize and apply biodiversity and ecosystem services valuation tools to quantify and
 monitor the environmental, economic and social value of biodiversity

 1.2.2 Integrate biodiversity and ecosystem services valuations into decision-making and to de-
 velop a business case for biodiversity

Biodiversity is often only associated with conservation through national parks and rare and endangered spe-
cies. This understanding fails to cover the deeper concept that biodiversity underpins our survival and well-
being, especially when around 70% of Namibia's population is dependent on the natural resource base for
their livelihood needs in terms of income, food, fuel, medicine and shelter.

The valuation of biodiversity and the critical ecosystem services it provides is thus an important priority for
NBSAP2 as a mainstreaming tool to create awareness and to influence policy makers and planners. Natural
resource accounts have been completed for wildlife, forestry, tourism and water use, and these have shed
light on the economic importance of these assets. These will be built on and absorbed in a new approach
dedicated to the valuation of biodiversity as a whole and its variety of ecosystem services, the results of which
will be disseminated and integrated into national, sectoral and local planning frameworks and budgets.

4.1.3 Target 3: By 2018, selected incentives for biodiversity conservation and sustain-
able use are in place and applied, and the most harmful subsidies are identified and
their phase out is initiated

 Key Performance Indicators:
 · List of assessed subsidies and measurement of magnitude of negative impact on biodiversity
 · List of analysed incentives and measurement of their potential positive impact on biodiversity
 · Environmental fiscal policy framework

 Strategic Initiatives:
 1.3.1 Analyze existing and identify potential incentives to encourage biodiversity conservation 
  and sustainable use and discourage activities that impact negatively on biodiversity

 1.3.2 Introduce environmental taxes and levies and market-based instruments as part of an
  Environmental Fiscal Reform Framework

A diverse range of subsidies and incentives are in place in Namibia to address sectoral problems and to pro-
mote economic growth and self-sufficiency. An assessment of the impacts of these different subsidies on the
conservation and sustainable use of biodiversity has not been undertaken, and should be an important step
towards removing or reforming harmful subsidies and for the development and application of positive incen-
tives.

The process to develop an Environmental Fiscal Reform Framework is also underway in Namibia, part of
which is aiming at the introduction of environmental taxes and levies for environmentally harmful activities and
the generation of market-based revenue streams as a source of long-term and sustainable funding for positive
environmental investments. This will form a key part of the process to develop positive biodiversity incentives.

4.2 STRATEGIC GOAL 2: Reduce the direct pressures on biodiversity and promote
the sustainable use of biological resources

Given Namibia's fragile and extremely variable environment, adaptive management of all natural resources
based on sound scientific data and integrated decision-making needs to be promoted. This will help to reduce
the pressures of development from agriculture and industrialization on biodiversity and guide the sustainable

                                                           20
utilisation of all natural resources. The critical elements considered necessary to achieve this strategic objec-
tive are:
 · The use of integrated decision-making platforms and science-based decision-support tools to guide

          all critical aspects of development
 · Strengthened application of the ecosystem approach to fisheries management
 · Increased adoption of sustainable land and forest management approaches
 · Measures and mechanisms to reduce the impact from pollution and waste on biodiversity.

4.2.1 Target 4: By 2022, the rate of loss and degradation of natural habitats outside
protected areas serving as ecological corridors or containing key biodiversity areas
or providing important ecosystem services is minimized through integrated land use
planning

 Key Performance Indicators:
 · Participatory Integrated Regional Land Use Plans with SEA approved by Cabinet for all Regions
 · Delineation of ecological corridors
 · Criteria for key biodiversity areas

 Strategic Initiatives:
 2.1.1: Strengthen the application of decision-support tools for environmental management
  and protection through improved land and resource use decisions and land use planning

 2.1.2: Strengthen institutional capacity at all levels to promote informed and integrated
  decision-making, harmonised policy frameworks and coordinated action on issues
  relating to land use planning

Namibia is home to a relatively large number of pristine natural habitats, many of which are home to high lev-
els of species endemism and species richness, as well as being providers of essential ecosystem services.
These areas are threatened to differing extents by various economic, demographic and social pressures.
For example, land and sea-based mining activities threaten habitats (often in protected areas) in the Namib
escarpment and marine ecosystems; forests in the north and north-eastern areas are vulnerable to illegal log-
ging, population pressure and land-use change; and wetlands, including perennial and ephemeral rivers, are
vulnerable to the over-abstraction of water from farming as well as pollution.

Preventing the loss of these sensitive habitats requires that the underlying causes are addressed through an
integrated approach to development. Emphasis needs to be based on the following tools to prevent the loss
of high biodiversity value habitats:
 · Integrated Land Use Planning
 · Mapping and protection of key biodiversity areas (KBAs)
 · The use of EIAs and SEAs to guide development decision-making, as well as the wider enforcement

          of the Environmental Management Act of 2007
 · Integrated mechanisms for natural resource governance at different levels including Integrated Coast-

          al Zone Management (ICZM) as well as Communal Land Boards and expert working groups on biodi-
          versity sensitive areas

4.2.2 Target 5: By 2022, all living marine and aquatic resources are managed sustain-
ably and guided by the ecosystem approach

 Key Performance Indicators:
 · Stocks of commercial fisheries resources at sustainable levels as proven by scientific data

                                                           21
 · Marine Spatial Planning for the greater Benguela Current Large Marine Ecosystem
 · Ecologically and Biodiversity Significant Areas identified as well as protection measures
 · Effective Monitoring, Control and Surveillance System in place for inland aquatic resources
 · Income generated from aquaculture and mariculture industries

 Strategic Initiatives:
 2.2.1:Ensure that all living marine resources are conserved and utilized sustainably based on
 ecosystem approach to fisheries (EAF) principles

 2.2.2:Ensure optimal utilization and conservation of inland aquatic resources

 2.2.3:Promote the sustainable management of the aquaculture and mariculture industries as
 vehicles for socio-economic development

The fishing sector has accounted for just over six per cent of GDP since 1994 and employs approximately
13,000 people directly (MET 2012a). Namibia's 1500km coastline falls within the nutrient rich Benguela Cur-
rent System, in which nutrient upwelling allows for huge shoals of pelagic and demersal fish, the bulk of which
are exported. Overfishing was rampant in Namibia in the colonial era, particularly in the 1960s and 1970s.
This led to the collapse of populations of several economically important fish species. The post-independent
Namibian government has put in place a number of measures to reverse this trend and to ensure the long-term
conservation, management and sustainable use of marine resources and coastal habitats. Nevertheless, fish
and aquatic invertebrate stocks as well as aquatic plants are threatened by habitat loss and alteration due to
off-shore mining and exploration; land-based pollution; invasive species; and climate change impacts.

An important part of NBSAP2 will be to build on the positive measures that have been undertaken by the Min-
istry of Fisheries and Marine Resources since Independence. Of particular relevance are the increased use of
the ecosystem approach; the elimination of destructive fishing practices; the establishment of representative
networks of marine protected areas; the transboundary management of marine resources through the Ben-
guela Current Commission; the use of closed seasons and minimum mesh sizes; strict by-catch regulations;
and improved capacity to monitor, control and survey these measures. While many of these approaches are
well-established in marine ecosystems, the need for them to be extended to inland fisheries was recom-
mended during the national NBSAP1 review workshop in July 2012.

The sustainable development of the aquaculture industry, guided by the Aquaculture Act of 2002, was identi-
fied in Vision 2030 as a priority area to enhance food security, generate employment and improve livelihoods
in rural areas. The Aquaculture Act contains strong measures to ensure that this industry grows in a respon-
sible manner, which will also be promoted through NBSAP2.

4.2.3 Target 6: By 2022, Principles of sound rangeland and sustainable forest man-
agement, and good environmental practices in agriculture are applied on at least 50
per cent of all relevant areas

 Key Performance Indicators:
 · Status of agriculture and rangeland report
 · Implemented Management Plans for Community Forests
 · Environmental Impact Assessments and Environmental Management Plans for large scale
  agricultural developments
 · Changes in vegetative / land use cover

 Strategic Initiatives:
 2.3.1:Strengthen sound agricultural and rangeland management practices which minimize the 

                                                           22
  negative impacts of agricultural / livestock production on biodiversity and ecosystem
  functioning

 2.3.2:Implement sustainable forest management practices in existing and new community
  forests to enhance conservation and sustainable use of biodiversity

 2.3.3:Increase community support to enhance livelihood options through biodiversity-based
  enterprises

Agriculture and forestry are critical sectors for sustainable resource use and poverty reduction in the rural
areas. An estimated 71 per cent of Namibia's land area is used as rangeland for cattle ranching and small-
stock farming (Mendelsohn 2006), much of which is recognized as heavily degraded (MAWF 2012). Crop
cultivation is vital to subsistence farmers in the northern regions and is being promoted on a commercial scale
through the Green Scheme Programme. Forest resources are an asset for communities, mainly in the north
and north-eastern regions, and forests are the source of many of Namibia's increasingly important indigenous
plant products.

Desertification and drought are key drivers of biodiversity loss in Namibia and with climate change set to lead
to increased rainfall variability and instances of extreme events, the threat to ecosystems and species diver-
sity is increasing and requires coordinated action. Unsustainable land management practices compound this
threat leading to problems such as bush encroachment by invader species; the disappearance of perennial
grasses; and the prevalence of bare soils which inhibit nutrient cycling, water infiltration, seedling development
and other essential ecological processes.

These practices need to be changed so that land and ecosystems maintain their productivity and integrity
and species loss is avoided over the long-term. Identified good management practices compatible with the
ecosystem approach such as rotational grazing, conservation agriculture, and community forestry will be pro-
moted, strengthened and expanded under this target. This is also an area of synergy with Namibia's National
Climate Change Strategy and Action Plan (NCC-SAP) and the Third National Action Programme (NAP3) to
the UNCCD.

4.2.4 Target 7: By 2022, pollution, including from excess nutrients, has been brought
to levels that are not detrimental to biodiversity and ecosystem health and function-
ing

 Key Performance Indicators:
 · Compliance with Environmental Management Plans (mining companies)
 · Trends in water quality in aquatic ecosystems (dams, rivers and Ramsar Sites)
 · Presence / absence of key indicator species
 · Pollution standards in place, respected and enforced

 Strategic Initiatives:
 2.4.1: Monitor and manage levels of pollution through a range of effective measures

 2.4.2:Manage all forms of waste in an effective and efficient manner to reduce its negative
  impact on the environment

Although Namibia is not heavily industrialised, pollution was considered extremely relevant to Namibia during
the NBSAP1 review workshop in July 2012. Pollution of water, the expanding number of intensive irrigation
schemes, and the use and disposal of chemicals were considered as major concerns as well as the rapid and
uncontrolled urbanization that is taking place.

                                                           23
The legislative framework and development of standards for the management of waste and for the control of
pollution is inadequate in Namibia, and this needs to be the starting point for tackling this issue. Institutional
capacity and cooperation to address this issue is another critical constraint that needs to be addressed, as is
the upgrading of infrastructure to store, handle and dispose of waste satisfactorily.

4.2.5 Target 8: By 2015, National review of invasive alien species in Namibia from 2004
is updated (including identification of pathways), and by 2018, priority measures are
in place to control and manage their impact

 Key Performance Indicators:
 · Updated National Review
 · Management Plans implemented to control most threatening alien invasive species

 Strategic Initiative:
 2.5.1:Develop mechanisms and measures to prevent the establishment and introduction of
  alien invasive species and to control or eradicate existing alien invasive species

A variety of sectors deals with alien invasive species in Namibia, and these different sectors need to be
coordinated to tackle this problem, which has been identified as a significant threat to biodiversity. A 2004
report identified and described Namibia's 15 most important invasive alien plant species as well as 11 alien
animal species, which have the potential to become extremely invasive in Namibia. This report will be updated
through NBSAP2.

There is also a lack of experts in this area and inadequate research and understanding of the issue among the
general public. Under NBSAP2, a working group of existing experts and key stakeholders will be established
to coordinate action on this issue.

4.2.6 Target 9: By 2016, ecosystems most vulnerable to climate change and their an-
thropogenic pressures are identified, and by 2018 appropriate adaptation measures
are developed and implemented in priority areas

 Key Performance Indicators:
 · Report on the vulnerability of Namibian ecosystems to climate change and associated
  anthropogenic pressures
 · Evaluation of implementation of appropriate measures

 Strategic Initiative:
 2.6.1:Undertake vulnerability assessment and develop relevant adaptation measures to enhance 
  climate change resilience of priority ecosystems

Namibia's ecosystems and biodiversity are particularly vulnerable to the impacts of climate change. Climate
change has the potential to reverse the country's development goals and is likely to have severe effects on
agricultural production, food security, fisheries and tourism (MET 2013). The effects of increased rainfall vari-
ability and an increase in the number of extreme events will place further stress on ecosystems, and these
effects will also impact on species distribution, composition and migration. Human population pressure will
further exacerbate this stress, particularly in peri-urban areas and in northern Namibia.

In line with Namibia's NCC-SAP, the main thrust of this target is to identify the ecosystems most vulnerable to
climate change and to identify and implement appropriate measures to make these ecosystems less vulner-
able to the impacts of climate change over the short to medium-term. These assessments will also serve to
pinpoint adaptation measures based on nature itself, i.e. ecosystem-based adaptation.

                                                           24
4.3 STRATEGIC GOAL 3: Improve the status of biodiversity by safeguarding ecosys-
tems, species and genetic diversity

This Strategic Goal deals with the conservation of the three main elements of biodiversity ­ ecosystems,
species diversity and genetic diversity. Namibia's protected area network and well-conserved species form
the backbone of the fast-growing tourism industry, while genetic diversity, particularly in terms of crops and
livestock, offers opportunities for more climate resilient agriculture and improved food security. Thus each ele-
ment of biodiversity will be promoted to improve the socio-economic situation of Namibian society.

4.3.1 Target 10: By 2018, existing terrestrial protected areas (national parks) are con-
served, effectively and equitably managed, within an ecologically representative and
well-connected system, and by 2020 coastal and marine areas9, of particular impor-
tance to biodiversity and ecosystem services, are identified and measures for their
protection initiated

 Key Performance Indicators:
 · Approved management plans for all national parks
 · Management Effectiveness of Namibia's terrestrial protected areas (national parks)
 · Sustainable Financing Plans for Protected Area System
 · Number of protected areas with connectivity corridors and managed buffer zones
 · Trends in revenue and employment generated through the protected area network

 Strategic Initiatives:
 3.1.1: Ensure that all protected areas are managed using participatory and science-based site 
  planning processes that incorporate clear biodiversity objectives, targets, management 
  strategies and monitoring programmes

 3.1.2:Enhance the infrastructure and natural resource base of all protected areas to make them 
  attractive destinations for tourists and tourism investors and to improve the working
  environment for staff

 3.1.3: Consolidate integrated park management to enable it to generate economic benefits, tackle 
  human wildlife conflicts and contribute to biodiversity protection integrated into the wider 
  landscape

Protected areas are a proven method for safeguarding habitats and species and important ecosystem ser-
vices. Namibia is home to a diverse range of protected areas including national parks; transfrontier conser-
vation areas; conservancies; freehold management units; private game reserves; tourism concessions; and
marine protected areas10. Many of these land uses also border each other, which offers good opportunities for
improved connectivity and integrated park management approaches.

National Parks cover approximately 18 per cent of the country's landmass, while other forms of protected
areas together bring some 43 per cent of Namibia under some form of conservation. Thus, the main focus
for Namibia under NBSAP2 is to strengthen and consolidate the management of existing protected areas. Specific

9 The coastal and marine element of the target is dealt with in section 2.2 of the Action Plan
10This section focuses mainly on national parks and TFCAs.

                                                           25
emphasis will be placed on improving ecological connectivity; engaging and benefiting local communities;
upgrading infrastructure; monitoring and evaluation of management effectiveness; eco-tourism approaches;
and building the capacity of protected area staff.

4.3.2 Target 11: By 2016, threatened and vulnerable species lists are updated and
measures implemented by 2019 to improve their conservation status

 Key Performance Indicators:
 · Number of Species Management Plans under implementation
 · Conservation status of threatened and vulnerable species

 Strategic Initiatives:
 3.2.1 Enhance the management of threatened and vulnerable species, and improve their
  conservation status

 3.2.2:Strengthen the framework for law enforcement and implementation with regard to the
  illegal trade in fauna and flora and derived products

Threatened and vulnerable plant and animal species are the main focus of this target. Namibia has performed
quite well in terms of the in-situ and ex-situ conservation of wildlife and plants. Management and recovery
plans have been initiated for a number of species and taxa. Research programmes of the MET's Directorate
of Natural Resources Management have driven the in-situ conservation of wildlife while ex-situ conservation
of plants has been greatly improved with targeted programmes through the National Plant Genetic Resources
Centre (NPGRC).

However, there is a critical need to strengthen human and infrastructural capacity of institutions such as the
NPGRC and the National Museum so that the ecological and management needs and conservation status
of threatened and endemic species are better known. Research and knowledge of micro-organisms, many
marine organisms and endophytes and extremophytes is also lacking.

The illegal trade of wildlife products and unregulated harvesting of plant and plant products are further major
concerns for which improved law enforcement is necessary. The MET-PASS project is promoting a more ho-
listic approach to law enforcement of wildlife crime, looking specifically at improving aspects of intelligence,
interception and prosecution. There may be useful lessons from this project for similar approaches to reduce
illegal trade in plant and animal resources.

4.3.3 Target 12: By 2020, Genetic diversity of cultivated plants and farmed animals is
maintained and enhanced


 Key Performance Indicators:
 · Strategy to develop and promote indigenous livestock breeds and crop varieties for adoption
  by local farmers
 · Operational institutional framework in place to implement and enforce Biosafety Act of 2006

 Strategic Initiatives:
 3.3.1:Maintain and enhance the genetic diversity of livestock and crop species through effective 
  in-situ and ex-situ conservation measures and the safe use of biotechnology to improve 
  food security and climate resilience of agriculture

 3.3.2:Strengthen capacity and institutional frameworks so that they are equipped to implement 
  and enforce the provisions of the Biosafety Act of 2006

                                                           26
Namibia's plant and animal genetic resources are particularly important for the sustainable development of
Namibia's agriculture industry and to improve food security, especially given the predicted impacts of climate
change on the agriculture sector. Indigenous breeds of livestock and crops have been replaced to a large ex-
tent by exotic breeds and crops which are often poorly adapted to Namibia's harsh farming environment. The
MAWF has sought to address this situation, however this process is at a relatively early stage, especially in
terms of livestock breeds. Particular emphasis needs to be placed on characterizing and conserving livestock
and crop breeds; breeds inventories and monitoring; and developing and promoting indigenous breeds for
adoption by local farmers.

Namibia has developed a legislative framework to promote the safe use of biotechnology and the manage-
ment of living modified organisms through the Biosafety Act in 2006. The legal and administrative basis to
implement this Act has been identified as a challenge as well as human resources and infrastructural capacity,
and insufficient awareness of the issue among the wider population. These challenges will be targeted directly
through NBSAP2.

4.4 STRATEGIC GOAL 4: Enhance the benefits to all from biodiversity and ecosystem
services

Namibia has consistently linked the need for conservation with the generation of benefits for its people through
the sustainable use of biodiversity. The devolution of rights and management over resources such as water,
wildlife and forests to the community level has been an important step in this process. Conservancies are
proving that wildlife will be well conserved once benefits from this conservation reach the local community.
This section focuses on increased beneficiation to local communities from biodiversity and ecosystem ser-
vices with particular focus on the CBNRM Programme, the management of wetlands, restoration of degraded
ecosystems, and capitalising on the opportunities from biotrade and bioprospecting.

4.4.1 Target 13: By 2022, ecosystems that provide essential services and contribute
to health, livelihoods and well-being are safeguarded, and restoration programmes
have been initiated for degraded ecosystems covering at least 15 per cent of the pri-
ority areas

 Key Performance Indicators:
 · Area under sustainable CBNRM and benefits to involved communities
 · Enforcement of agreements reached under the different transboundary water commissions
 · Implementation of Integrated Water Resources Management Plan
 · Area of degraded ecosystems and identified priority areas for action
 · Number of rehabilitation and restoration programmes and area covered

 Strategic Initiatives:
 4.1.1: Consolidate and further strengthen the implementation of the CBNRM Policy and
  Programmes

 4.1.2: Foster the implementation of integrated water management plans, including restoration and 
  protection of critical wetlands systems, and taking into account transboundary issues

 4.1.3:Undertake the rehabilitation and restoration of land degraded through unsustainable land 
  management practices and establish biodiversity offsets

Namibia's CBNRM Programme has led to the establishment of 79 conservancies on 18 per cent of the coun-
try's landmass. Conservancies are delivering substantial benefits to communities in the form of income gen-
eration from tourism and biotrade as well as employment, while also improving wildlife populations across the

                                                           27
country. An estimated 23 of these conservancies were financially self-sufficient in 2011 and the Programme
will be further strengthened during the lifespan of NBSAP2 to ensure its viability over the long term.

Due to Namibia's high level of aridity, wetlands are a critical refuge for biodiversity and provider of essential
ecosystem services. Wetland systems in Namibia include marine, estuarine, riverine, lacustrine and palus-
trine systems. Each of these is affected by a range of stakeholders and require an integrated approach to
management. This process is underway in Namibia with the establishment of basin management committees
and transboundary river commissions. NBSAP2 will seek to strengthen this more holistic approach to tackle
threats such as pollution; alien invasive species; over-abstraction of water and groundwater depletion.

This target also covers the restoration of degraded lands, which offers linkages with Namibia's contribution to
a land degradation neutral world and its NAP3 to the UNCCD. The most serious type of degradation requir-
ing rehabilitation and restoration in Namibia is bush-encroached land. An estimated 26 million hectares of
land is bush-encroached and the rehabilitation of this land has considerable economic, social and ecological
potential.

Many areas home to rich biodiversity and rare and endemic species, including the Namib escarpment and
Tsau //Khaeb (Sperrgebiet) area, are also characterized by the presence of minerals. The negative impacts
from exploration and mining activities can be severe on these areas. Landscape alteration; soil and water con-
tamination; and the loss of critical habitats can compromise ecosystems and reduce tourism potential in these
areas. A national policy on mining in protected areas is currently under development to reduce this threat and
to promote the restoration of degraded areas. Some good practice examples of restoration have been under-
taken in the Tsau //Khaeb (Sperrgebiet) Park through Namdeb. It is suggested that standards and guidelines
are put in place to promote a standardised approach to rehabilitation, while instruments such as biodiversity
offsets should also be explored during NBSAP2.

4.4.2 Target 14: By 2015, national legislation giving effect to the Nagoya Protocol is
in force and by 2018 fully operational to ensure that benefits are fair and equitably
shared from the conservation and sustainable use of biodiversity

 Key Performance Indicators:
 · Accession to the Nagoya Protocol
 · Gazetting of ABS national legislation and regulation
 · Institutional arrangements in place including the Competent National Authority and National 
  Focal Point (Genetic Resources and Traditional Knowledge Unit within MET), and national 
  bioprospecting account within EIF
 · Number of ABS agreements

 Strategic Initiatives:
 4.2.1:Finalize and implement the processes of acceding to the Nagoya Protocol as well as the
  Access to Genetic Resources and Associated Traditional Knowledge Bill

Namibia's domestic legislation on ABS has been under development since 1998. The draft ABS bill was put
on hold in 2006, until international legislation on ABS was finalized so that the bill could be harmonized with
the provisions of this legislation. With the agreement of the Nagoya Protocol in late 2010, work resumed on
Namibia's domestic ABS bill in 2011 and the regional and national consultative process was finalized in late
2011. It is expected that the bill will be enacted by 2014. Draft regulations are already formulated.

Thus implementation of the Bill will be a key focus area of NBSAP2, given the potential of ABS to unlock the

                                                           28
opportunities from biotrade and bioprospecting for local communities. The establishment and operationaliza-
tion of a permanent Competent National Authority on ABS to replace the Interim Bioprospecting Committee
will be a key step towards promoting and regulating biotrade linked to traditional knowledge, bioprospecting
and the negotiation of ABS agreements.

4.5 STRATEGIC GOAL 5: Enhance implementation of NBSAP2 through participatory
planning, knowledge management and capacity building

NBSAP2 has been developed in a highly participatory manner and requires action from a multitude of stake-
holders at all levels. A strong coordination framework through the NBSAP2 Steering Committee is in place to
ensure that implementation is carried out in an integrated and harmonized manner, and to mainstream biodi-
versity and NBSAP2 priorities into other sectors at all levels.

Under this strategic goal, the following stakeholders are targeted:
 · Traditional Authorities and local communities involved in the management and use of biodiversity and

          other natural resources.
 · Research institutions to strengthen Namibian capacity in science, research and technology for im-

          proved biodiversity and ecosystem management.
 · Government (Ministry of Finance and National Planning Commission), international community and

          the private sector partners to mobilize resources for the effective implementation of NBSAP2.

The issue of capacity building, although prominent under this goal, is considered a cross-cutting element and
has also been identified as needed under other thematic areas including environmental economics (section
1.2 in action plan), Institutional capacity for environmental management (section 2.1.2 in action plan), CBNRM
(see sections 2.3 and 3.1 in action plan), biosafety, (see section 3.3.2 in action plan), and ABS (see section
4.2 in action plan).

4.5.1 Target 15: By 2020, Traditional knowledge and the innovations and practices of
indigenous and local communities relevant to the conservation and sustainable use
of biodiversity are recognized, respected and promoted

 Key Performance Indicators:
 · Biocultural protocols and practices of local communities documented according to mutually 
  agreed terms
 · System(s) in place to protect and document traditional knowledge as a basis for research and 
  development of commercial biodiversity products

 Strategic Initiative:
 5.1.1 Promote the role of traditional knowledge, innovations and practices in the management 
  and use of biodiversity

Traditional Authorities have a key role to play in the management of natural resources in Namibia with the
Traditional Authorities Act of 2000 giving them the mandate to ensure that members of their communities use
natural resources in a manner that conserves the environment and maintains ecosystems. Traditional knowl-
edge, referring to the knowledge, innovations and practices of indigenous and local communities relating to
biodiversity, has also helped to preserve, maintain and increase biodiversity over centuries in Namibia. Tradi-
tional knowledge has also played a key role in facilitating the development of new products from biodiversity
and has helped scientists to understand biodiversity.

Thus, traditional knowledge of Namibian communities needs to be carefully harnessed and regulated so that
these communities benefit to a greater extent from their biodiversity-related expertise. The development of

                                                           29
bio-cultural protocols; systems to protect and document traditional practices; the incorporation of traditional
resource management approaches into school and tertiary curricula; and the further empowerment of Tradi-
tional Authorities over issues of biodiversity are among the priority activities identified for implementation of
NBSAP2.

4.5.2 Target 16: By 2022, knowledge, science base and technologies relating to bio-
diversity and ecosystem management are improved and made relevant to political
decision- makers

 Key Performance Indicators:
 · Trends in the number of research papers published on biodiversity from PoN, UNAM and other 
  academic research institutions
 · Trends in the number of research projects on biodiversity undertaken by state research
  institutions (Gobabeb TRC, Etosha Ecological Institute, NBRI, NATMIRC, DART, DoF)
 · Investment and partnerships in biodiversity-related research, technologies and infrastructure
 · Policy briefs from research findings relating to biodiversity

 Strategic Initiatives:
 5.2.1 Promote and encourage research that contributes to the knowledge and understanding of 
  Namibia's biodiversity and ecosystems services and their values

 5.2.2:Enhance national capacity in biosystematics to provide support to biodiversity
  conservation management

 5.2.3:Foster international cooperation and opportunities for information exchange and support in 
  the field of biodiversity at the regional and international level for mutual benefit

 5.2.4 Develop the modalities of a possible science policy interface on environmental issues

Namibia's National Commission on Research, Science and Technology (NCRST) was established in 2012 to
coordinate, monitor and supervise research, science and technology and to provide policy guidance to the
research, science and technology innovation systems in Namibia. It will also facilitate the establishment of the
National Research, Science and Technology Fund.

The NCRST is represented on the NBSAP2 Steering Committee and, research, as a critical tool for the man-
agement of biodiversity, will be promoted through the NCRST, in the following areas:
 · Monitoring of natural resources, including marine, forest and wildlife resources (with the full involve-

          ment of communities) to guide sustainable utilisation;
 · Taxonomy to improve knowledge of unknown or little known species (including those which may be of

          commercial use) such as microbial organisms, extremophytes, endophytes and marine organisms;
 · Product testing and quality assurance and standards development;
 · Innovation and the development of new biodiversity-based products;
 · Development of new adaptive approaches to fisheries and land management.

Modalities to communicate relevant research findings to policy-makers, through a science policy interface
mechanism, will be explored during NBSAP2.

4.5.3 Target 17: By 2022, mobilization of financial resources from all sources has been
increased compared to the period 2008-2012 to allow for the effective implementation
of this strategy and action plan

                                                           30
 Key Performance Indicators:
 · Volume of Domestic Funding per annum
 · Increase in the number of sources (including private sector)
 · Volume of Official Development Assistance (multi-lateral and bi-lateral)
 Strategic Initiative:
 5.3.1 Develop and realise a comprehensive resource mobilization strategy for implementation
 of NBSAP2
Namibia is committed through NBSAP2 to implementing decision XI/5 of UNCBD COP11 in Hyderabad, India
which called on governments to implement the following measures among others:
 · Identify and seek funding support from diverse sources including regional and international donor

          agencies, foundations and, as appropriate, through private- sector involvement;
 · Establish strategic partnerships with other Parties and other Governments and with various organiza-

          tions, regional bodies or centres of excellence with a view to pooling resources and/or widening op-
          portunities and possibilities for mobilizing resources from various sources;
 · Identify and maximize opportunities for technical cooperation with regional and international organiza-
          tions, institutions and development assistance agencies;
 · Ensure efficient use of available resources and adopt cost-effective approaches to capacity-building.

5. MONITORING AND EVALUATION FRAMEWORK

A monitoring and evaluation framework was an important missing element in NBSAP1 and the potential mo-
dalities of this framework were deliberated on in detail during the consultative process for NBSAP2. An appro-
priate framework was considered necessary to track ongoing progress as well as the quality and impact of ac-
tivities being undertaken by the various sectors to achieve the strategic aims and targets included in NBSAP2.

Monitoring and evaluation of NBSAP2 will form part of an ongoing, continuous and cyclical process to align
the actions outlined in the NBSAP2 strategy to the long-term development framework of Vision 2030 and
medium term NDPs. Monitoring and evaluation will report against the 17 targets included in NBSAP2, each
of which is considered specific, measurable, attainable, relevant and time-bound (SMART). The indicators
per activity will also be reported on as will the expenditure on the planned activities. This will help to reveal if
scarce national resources are being effectively allocated and utilized.

During the NBSAP2 consultative process, it became clear that there is a lack of baseline data in many of
the areas critical to biodiversity management. This presents a challenge to monitoring progress towards the
achievement of the targets as set out in NBSAP2, and the establishing of reliable baseline data will be a key
objective for the early years of NBSAP2.

The monitoring and evaluation of NBSAP2 will be coordinated by the newly established Division of Multi-
Lateral Environmental Agreements under the MET, with support from the cross-sectoral NBSAP2 Steering
Committee. The Division of Multilateral Environmental Agreements serves as Secretariat to the Committee,
and provision has been made in the Terms of Reference of the Committee for it to support the monitoring and
evaluation of NBSAP2. All of the activities prioritized in NBSAP2 are to be implemented by institutions repre-
sented on the NBSAP2 steering committee, which should facilitate the process of coordination and monitoring
and evaluation.

It is envisaged that the different key institutions represented on the NBSAP2 steering committee will report
back to the committee and high level stakeholders on an annual basis in terms of their progress and chal-
lenges with regard to achieving the targets and strategic goals of NBSAP2. The MET will take responsibility to
compile these reports, which will provide a baseline on status of implementation, serve as a guide for future
strategic planning, and contribute information towards Namibia's national reporting to the CBD.

An independent mid-term evaluation of NBSAP2 will be undertaken in mid-2017. Progress in implementation
will also be reported to the CBD through the 5th National Report in 2014, the 6th National Report in 2018 and
the 7th National Report in 2022. A final independent evaluation of NBSAP2, to be undertaken in 2021, will
provide information on Namibia's contribution towards the achievement of the Aichi Targets as well as lessons
and direction for the development of a third NBSAP.

7. FUNDING PLAN AND STRATEGY

A conservative estimate of the funding required to fully implement the strategy and action plan is N$ 494 mil-
lion over the next nine years. The estimated costs of indicative activities is included in the last column of the
Action Plan.

These figures refer only to these specific activities but not to the ministerial operational budget framing them.

Inadequate funding levels are a major impediment to effective national biodiversity conservation and can
severely affect the attainment of set targets. Unfortunately conservation spending baseline data is difficult to
collate and incomplete in many countries. Namibia is no exception. It is therefore vital that activities are under-
taken to quantify the relative adequacy of the levels of Namibian's conservation finance.

It is also important that such baseline assessment adequately carry out a gap analysis of the level of under-
funding in biodiversity conservation. Pointers can be derived from previous estimates of the MET's Strategic
Plan which had annual spending need for implementation close to three times higher than the average budget
appropriations of the MET's Medium Term Expenditure Framework (MTEF). Rough estimates during the NB-
SAP I period depicts government spending accounting between 65%-75% of total biodiversity funding on
average, whilst donor aid covered the remaining 25%. This underpins the strategic importance of donor aid in
ensuring optimal conservation funding in Namibia and in narrowing funding gaps.

Leveraging on ensuring the diversification of sources of funding as a strategy is also very important. This
should ensure that domestic spending is aided by donor spending, private philanthropy and conservation trust
funds. Finally innovative forms of financing should also be explored to ensure that appropriate economic in-
struments and financing mechanisms are identified and utilised. The utilisation of such economic instruments
and financial mechanisms should be driven by their practicality in implementation as well as their congruency
with the broader economic, political and social and equity dynamics of the country.
