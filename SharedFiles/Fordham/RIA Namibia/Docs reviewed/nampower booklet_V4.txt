    4.2 NETWORK EXPANSION
        AND STRENGTHENING

    Demand for electricity has grown steadily
    in Namibia, showing a 150% increase over
    the past 22 years as shown in Figure 3
    below. This growth in demand requires
    strengthening and expansion of the
    transmission system to be able to supply
    this demand.

    6. IMPLEMENTATION, MONITORING
       AND EVALUATION

      A strategy implementation plan as well as
      a program has been rolled-out to ensure
      the successful execution of the 2014 -
      2018 Corporate Strategy and Business
      Plan. This includes the cascading of
      the Corporate Strategy and Business
      Plan into Business Units as well as at
      individual levels through the Performance
      Management System.

      During the cascading process, the
      emphasis was placed on ensuring that
      the operational activities throughout the
      company are aligned to the corporate
      strategies and objectives.

      In terms of the monitoring and evaluation
      mechanisms, NamPower has adapted
      a quarterly and annual Plan-Do-Review
      tool to take stock of the achievements
      that are being made as well as to identify
      bottlenecks that require corrective
      intervention measures to address
      challenges that may hinder the successful
      implementation of the Corporate Strategy
      and Business Plan 2014 ­ 2018.
