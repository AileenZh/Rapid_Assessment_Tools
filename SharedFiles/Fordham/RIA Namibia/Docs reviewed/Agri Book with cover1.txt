                     The development of this Strategic Plan benefited from a consultative approach involving all
                     key stakeholders. I take this opportunity to thank all stakeholders for their valuable contribution
                     to this process. The implementation of the Strategic Plan will be the responsibility of all
                     management and staff members of MAWF, supported by all its stakeholders. It is therefore
                     incumbent upon all staff members to put their maximum effort in ensuring that the stated
                     strategic objectives are achieved.
                     This Strategic Plan will form the basis of MAWF's performance management system.
                     Monitoring, evaluation and progress reporting will be done on a regular basis. Individual staff
                     performance and appraisals will be based on the division scorecards which will be carried out
                     on an annual basis. The management and staff should be committed to realize the outcomes
                     envisaged in this Strategic Plan for the benefit of the agriculture, water and forestry sectors,
                     their stakeholders and the sector's contribution to the national development goals as set out
                     in NDP4 and Vision 2030.
                     The Strategic Plan being a living document, MAWF will remain open-minded and flexible
                     in making necessary adjustments and refinements as required during its implementation.
                     This is our commitment to our stakeholders, with whose support and co-operation, I have no
                     doubt, we will succeed. This Strategic Plan will serve as a roadmap to MAWF for the next
                     Five Years, 2012/13 to 2016/17 and I urge staff members and stakeholders to be committed
                     to see to it that what we have set out in the Strategic Plan is implemented thereby contributing
                     to the overall achievement of the desired outcomes by the end of NDP4 period. In so doing,
                     agriculture, water and forestry sectors activities will undoubtedly impact positively on the
                     lives of all Namibians. It is therefore a challenge for all of us to live up to the expectations and
                     deliver tangible results systematically over the next 5 years. To this effect, MAWF will assume
                     a business-like approach through effective and efficient management of programmes within
                     its mandate in order to contribute to local growth and development.

                                    EXECUTIVE SUMMARY                                                       MAWF STRATEGIC PLAN

The MAWF Strategic Plan for the period 2012/13 to 2016/17 (from 1 April 2012) is a framework
that outlines the approaches and activities that MAWF intends to take in order to achieve a
steady and sustained growth in the medium term. This plan provides an integrated picture
of where MAWF is going to be over the next five years and to serve as a communication
vehicle for conveying its direction. It will be used to guide the Ministry in the implementation of
programmes, projects and activities as well as allocated resources in response to its mandate
and challenges. This Strategic Plan consists of eleven (11) strategic programmes which have
their corresponding strategic objectives.

This document is aligned to both the Fourth National Development Plan (NDP4) and the
Sectoral Execution Plans (SEPs). Based on the Strategic Plan matrix, this plan forms the
basis for managing and monitoring performances of MAWF staff members.

The Government of the Republic of Namibia has launched its Fourth National Development
Plan (NDP4) during the 2012/13 financial year which sets out the Nation's direction for the
next five years. During the formulation of this high level medium-term plan, Government has
identified Agriculture, Water and Forestry among other sectors as some of the economic
priorities which have the potential to contribute to the achievement of Vision 2030.

The Ministry of Agriculture, Water and Forestry (MAWF) is identified as the lead institution
responsible for two subsectors namely; Agriculture and Forestry as well Water and Sanitation.
This Ministry will focus its energy and resources on strategic areas with potential to tackle the
sector's developmental challenges.

During the formulation of this Strategic Plan, MAWF has developed implementable strategies
which will contribute to the agriculture sector experiencing average real growth of 4 per cent
per annum; contribute toward ensuring that the proportion of severely poor individuals has
dropped from 15.8% in 2009/10 to below 10% by 2016/17 as well as increase access to
portable water for human consumption from the current 85.5 per cent to 100 per cent of the
population while ensuring that there are sufficient water reserves for industrialization.

The MAWF is also expected to contribute towards the elimination of open defecation by
the year 2017, which calls for increased coverage, use of improved sanitation facilities and
improvement in hygiene and sanitation practices.

                                                                                                        ii
MAWF STRATEGIC PLAN  The MAWF will ensure that the strategic initiatives are implemented and the desired outcomes
                     are achieved with direct involvement of all stakeholders. This plan will not only expedite but
                     will also enhance the attainment of the sector's desired outcomes.
                     Critical success factors for successful strategy execution are also presented in this plan.
                     These are: leadership, commitment and ownership; teamwork; effective communication;
                     good stakeholder relation; alignment to the budget; training and development; performance
                     recognition; monitoring and evaluation as well as performance management system roll-
                     out. Without these critical building blocks in place, it would be impossible to successfully
                     implement this Strategic Plan.
                     Undoubtedly, successful and effective implementation of this plan requires that the Ministry is
                     appropriately resourced. That notwithstanding, the Ministry will strive to achieve its strategic
                     objectives as outlined in this Strategic Plan with the resources at its disposal.
                     Timely project planning, tender advertisements and adjudication, capital projects budget
                     execution and general service delivery to the people are not options but must be done.
                     To this end, MAWF staff members as the front liners are called upon to remain committed,
                     focused and resourceful in ensuring successful implementation of this plan.

                                    1. INTRODUCTION                                                       MAWF STRATEGIC PLAN

1.1 Introduction and Background

The Ministry of Agriculture, Water and Forestry is one of the Government Institutions that is leading
in working towards fulfilling the mandate through the Performance Management System (PMS).
Performance Management System (PMS) is a Public Service Reform Initiative aimed at transforming
the Public Service into a performance driven organization at all levels central and sub-national levels,
improving service delivery to the public and foster operational efficiency within the Public Service.
This will in turn result in effectively achieving National Development Plans (NDPs) and Vision 2030
goals respectively.

The need arose to align and harmonize a newly developed Strategic Plan 2012/13-2016/17 of the
Ministry of Agriculture, Water and Forestry with NDP4 to accelerate the implementation of the high
level goals and ensure desired outcomes. The Ministry of Agriculture, Water and Forestry embraced
the Performance Management System as its vehicle to fulfill its mandate "to promote, manage and
utilize the agriculture, water and forestry resources sustainably".

The second reason for developing a new Strategic Plan is to develop a Vision and Mission State-
ments, core values and objectives that coincide and link the operational planning with NDP4 and
MTEF. The new plan will outline responsibilities to determine how the strategic objectives and pro-
grammes will be achieved and who will be responsible for carrying them out. Once the Strategic
Plan is adopted, annual operational plans for the next five years need to be developed to regularly
monitor and evaluate the implementation of the Strategic Plan in order to enhance ongoing activities
and operations.

1.2 Purpose of Strategic Plan

A Strategic Plan is a very crucial document, which will drive the Ministry of Agriculture, Water and
Forestry to live-up to its Mandate and achieve its Vision. The Strategic Plan stands out as the road-
map to success if fully implemented and achieved. A Strategic Plan is the foundation of Performance
Management System (PMS). It sets clear strategic objectives and allows the organization to manage
performance in order to achieve them. It forms a basis for Performance Agreements at individual/staff
level thereby translating a strategy into desired action by the entire organization.

In addition, a Strategic Plan integrates and unifies an organization around a shared vision and guides
decisions in the allocation of scarce resources. The methodology followed to develop the Ministry of
Agriculture, Water and Forestry Strategic Plan was based on the Public Service Strategic Planning
Framework that has been developed by the Office of the Prime Minister to guide the process of de-
veloping Strategic Plans across the entire Public Service. With the implementation of NDP4 it was
necessary to adjust/amend the framework to clearly indicate the linkage. This is not only done for
improving productivity and enhancing efficiency in the Ministry of Agriculture, Water and Forestry but
also for the effective implementation of the Performance Management System (PMS).

Through Strategic Planning the Ministry of Agriculture, Water and Forestry is therefore able to:
Â· Clearly define where it is going (Vision);
Â· Establish purpose and direction and how to get there (Mission);
Â· Distinguish priority actions from non-priority actions;
Â· Allocate resources to objectives and programmes (strategies);
Â· Take advantage of available capacity.

                                                                                                  1

                     Defining the Strategic Programmes and Objectives is not enough. A matrix for the Strategic
                     Plan was developed to ensure that there is a clear direction and successful implementation
                     of strategy. The following terminologies are used in the matrix;
                     Â· Strategic Objective; is the statement of the desired result.
                     Â· NDP4 DO means desired outcome which is the expected end result at the end of Na-

                              tional Development Plan 4.
                     Â· Key Performance Indicators; are simply measures of performance. They answer

                              the question "How can success be measured and tracked?" Indicators help MAWF to
                              define and evaluate how successful is the Ministry towards the implementation of the
                              initiatives.
                     Â· Targets; simply indicate the desired result of a performance measure. The level of
                              performance or rate of improvement needed or required. There is a strong correlation
                              of an orientation towards the future objective. They are established by month; quarter,
                              half-year, year. Its purpose is to keep the MAWF focused on achieving the set Strate-
                              gic Objectives.
                     Â· Programme/Projects; are means by which the MAWF achieves the strategic objec-
                              tives. They drive strategic performance. They should be at a higher level and strategic
                              in nature avoiding the business as usual not consolidating business as usual. Pro-
                              grammes are long term in nature and will comprise projects which are short term. They
                              should bring about change in service delivery in the MAWF.
                     Â· Resource Estimates; Estimate costs for the initiatives that will be required. Resource
                              allocations (Budgets) should be aligned, so as to ensure the achievement of maximum
                              results with minimum resources. The focus should be on strategic outcomes/customer
                              benefits/impacts as defined in the Strategic Plan.
                     Â· Accountable Unit; A unit identified and given the accountability to take the ownership
                              of the initiative set out in the Strategic Plan.

Critical Success Factors (CSFs) are those essential areas of activities in which an organisa-
tion must perform well in order to ensure the successful execution of its strategy. It is essen-
tial that Ministry of Agriculture, Water and Forestry carefully manage the following factors to
achieve success in the implementation of programmes and projects:

1. Leadership, Commitment and Ownership: In order to achieve what is set out in this
      Strategic Plan, the Ministry of Agriculture, Water and Forestry need to inspire, motivate
      and develop its people and make them feel valued. This takes special leadership quali-
      ties. Through creating a firm but fair leadership style, focusing on developing mutual
      trust, shared beliefs and strong relations, staff members in return will show commitment
      and ownership for the part they play in the success of the Ministry.

2. Teamwork; The Ministry of Agriculture, Water and Forestry need to create a work culture
      that values collaboration. It is necessary to create an environment where staff members,
      Management understand and believe that thinking, planning, decisions and actions are
      better when done cooperatively. Staff members, Management should recognize, and
      even assimilate, the belief that "none of them is as good as all of them." Perhaps the
      most obvious reason for encouraging teamwork in the implementation of Strategic Plans
      is because it enables organization to do so much more. Therefore, effective teamwork
      can produce incredible results but it takes a great deal of hard work and compromise.

3. Effective Communication; it is imperative for the success of this Strategic Plan that
      managers are able to communicate their ideas clearly, so that staff members definitely
      know what is asked of them, then the subordinates will, consequently, perform their
      tasks correspondingly. A good style of management is required, as well as a positive
      approach to communication in order to ensure that staff members and supervisors un-
      derstand each other, and are more effective when caring out their tasks.

4. Good Stakeholder Relation; it is imperative for the Ministry of Agriculture, Water and
