                                                                                                                                     1

                RAPID INTEGRATED ASSESSMENT ­ NAMIBIA SDG PROFILE

UNDP conducted a rapid integrated assessment of Namibia's Fourth National Development Plan and
relevant sector plans and strategies against the SDG targets. The assessment provides a gap analysis of
the SDG targets that are not prioritized in the current plan and the targets that have been prioritized by multiple
sectors. Sectors indicated are those listed in the Fourth National Development Plan.
Template 1 provides a quick snapshot of integration/gap analysis and the SDG targets that are prioritized by
multiple sectors. For SDG targets prioritized by multiple sectors ­ it is expected that joint planning is conducted
or an assessment of impact and potential results be conducted with concerned sectors (to understand if cross-
sectoral interventions are mutually reinforcing).

Template 2 provides further details, including targets and corresponding indicators for monitoring that are
drawn from the National Development Plan, and relevant sector plans and strategies.
                                                                                                                                     2

In addition to the Fourth National Development plan, the assessment drew from the following sector plans and
strategies:

      Ministry of Education: Strategic Plan 2012-2017
      Ministry of Health and Social Services: National Health Policy Framework 2010-2020
      Ministry of Agriculture, Water & Forestry: Strategic Plan 2012-13/2016-17
      Ministry of Environment and Tourism: Namibia's Second National Biodiversity Strategy and Action

          Plan 2013-2022
      Ministry of Trade and Industry: Growth at Home: Namibia's Execution Strategy for Industrialisation
      Ministry of Finance: Namibia Financial Sector Strategy 2011-2021
      NamPower 2014-2018 Corporate Strategy and Business Plan
      Intended Nationally Determined Contributions (INDC) of The Republic of Namibia to the United

          Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change
      Ministry of Environment and Tourism: National Policy on Tourism for Namibia

The following are key observations drawn from the assessment:

     1) There is some degree of integration of the SDG targets into Namibia's Fourth National Development
          Plan. 70 SDG targets have been prioritized out of 119 with 6 targets that are not applicable and the
          means of implementation targets under each SDG excluded. While there are a number of SDG targets
          that are well integrated into the NDP4 and sector strategies and plans, significant gaps remain that
          may need to be addressed.

     2) The assessment indicates gaps related to the following SDG targets:

           4.6

                decrease the direct economic losses relative to global gross domestic product caused by disasters, including
                water-related disasters, with a focus on protecting the poor and people in vulnerable situations

           11.6

                By 2030, reduce the adverse per capita environmental impact of cities, including by paying special attention to
                air quality and municipal and other waste management

           11.7

                By 2030, provide universal access to safe, inclusive and accessible, green and public spaces, in particular for

                their capacity to provide benefits that are essential for sustainable development

Note: Information on SDG 16 is sparse. More details are needed to assess if there are gaps related to
this goal.
                                                                                                                                4

3) According to the Namibian Statistics Agency, unemployment among youth (persons aged 15-34 years)
     increased drastically from 28% in 2011 to 43.4% in 2013 and about half of the youth were employed in
     the informal sector. The Agency also indicated persistent high levels of unemployment among female
     youth. Achieving literacy and numeracy among youth is a critical step towards gaining productive
     employment. Neither the NDP4 nor the Namibia Education Strategy include an objective or target on
     youth and adult literacy and numeracy (SDG 4.6). This may need to be looked into.

4) Overall, gender does not appear to be well addressed in the NDP4 and the sector plans and
     strategies reviewed. Important gaps include ensuring women's full and effective participation and
     equal opportunities for leadership at all levels of decision making in political, economic and
     public life (SDG 5.5), the recognition and value of unpaid care and domestic work through the
     provision of public services, infrastructure and social protection policies as nationally appropriate (SDG
     5.4), and the elimination of all forms of violence against all women and girls in the public and
     private spheres (SDG 5.2).

5) A critical gap in the NDP4 is on universal access to affordable, reliable and modern energy
     services (SDG 7.1). While the NDP4 highlights challenges related to energy supply, including an
     electricity deficit of 140MW (may be higher), issues with the importation of the bulk of electricity from
     South Africa, and time constraints in building new electricity-generation capacity to address immediate
     supply constraints, there is only reference to having adequate base load energy to support industry
     demand. With only 47.3% of the population having access to electricity (World Bank 2012), providing
     universal access to affordable, reliable and modern energy services is critical to achieve sustainable
     development.

6) While the NDP4 highlights the creation of jobs in several sectors, it does not mention this in the
     context of creating productive employment and decent work for all, particularly for women and
     persons with disabilities (SDG 8.5). It also does not mention equal pay for work of equal value to
     address inequalities/disparities in employment.

7) Overall, SDG 12 on ensuring sustainable consumption and production patterns has not been
     well addressed. Its implementation is critical in achieving overall development plans, reducing future
     economic, environmental and social costs, strengthening economic competitiveness and reducing
     poverty. In this regard, it is important to engage with businesses, encouraging them to adopt
     sustainable practices and to integrate sustainability information into their reporting cycle.

8) Neither the NDP4 nor Namibia's NBSAP 2 makes explicit reference to `mountain ecosystems' (SDG
     15.4). However, the work on ecosystems and biodiversity (reflected in the NBSAP 2) most likely also
     relates to mountain ecosystems. This would perhaps need to be clarified.

9) SDG 17 on means of implementation will need to be looked into more carefully on areas related to
     finance (ODA and domestic resources), technology (transfer of technology, North-South and South-
     South Collaboration), capacity-building, and data, monitoring and accountability issues.

10) The assessment identified various cross-sectoral linkages and these have been detailed in
     template 2. It may be good to discuss whether there is collaboration between these sectors in their
     planning and implementation of actions and how their interventions complement each other's plan.
     While the assessment tried to identify as many cross-sectoral linkages, there may be additional
     linkages that may need to be identified for effective SDG implementation. This would need to be
     discussed.
