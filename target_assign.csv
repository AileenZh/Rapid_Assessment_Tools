EXECUTIVE SUMMARY  The Eleventh Five Year Plan is the second five year plan to be implemented since  the introduction of Democratic Constitutional Monarchy in 2008. It builds on the  strong foundations that have been laid since the inception of planned development  in 1961. It is guided by His Majesty the King’s Vision for Bhutan and the national  priorities that have been consistently underscored in Royal Addresses to the nation.  The Plan sets out an ambitious development agenda to achieve this objective and  fulfill the current Government’s pledge of ensuring “Prosperity for All” through  effective empowerment of the people – “Wangtse Chhirpel”","By 2030, increase the economic benefits to Small Island developing States and least developed countries from the sustainable use of marine resources, including through sustainable management of fisheries, aquaculture and tourism "

Pursuant to Article 9 2 of the Constitution, which  directs the State “to promote those conditions that will enable the pursuit of Gross  National Happiness”, the operational aspects of GNH have been strengthened,  most notably with the introduction of the GNH Index in 2008 and the GNH Policy  Screening Tool in 2009. The GNH Index is based on biennial surveys and provides an  overview of performance across 9 domains of GNH that include health, education,  living standards, ecological diversity and resilience, good governance, psychological  wellbeing, time use, community vitality and cultural diversity and resilience.  Based on the 2010 GNH Index composite score of 0.743, 41 percent of Bhutanese  were identified as happy being sufficient in 73 percent of the domains while the  remaining 59 percent enjoyed sufficiency in 57 percent of the domains. The GNH  Policy Screening has been used as a tool to assess the impact of new policies on GNH  and to mainstream GNH into all new policies being formulated against twenty two  variables representing the 9 domains of GNH. Since its introduction, twelve policies  related to human resources, youth, education, health and nutrition, land, natural  resources, and industries have been approved","By 2025, prevent and significantly reduce marine pollution of all kinds, in particular from land-based activities, including marine debris and nutrient pollution "

9,10,0.025719327,13,13.2,"A notable paradigm shift of the Eleventh Plan is the adoption of a Results Based  Planning (RBP) framework that articulates clear outcomes and outputs that need  to be achieved in order to realize the Eleventh Plan objective of “Self reliance and  Inclusive Green Socio Economic Development”. The outcomes are defined as Key      Eleventh Five Year Plan   Main Document Volume I  Results Areas (KRAs) at the national, sectoral, and Dzongkhag level and categorized  under each of the four pillars of GNH. At the national level, 16 National Key Result  Areas (NKRAs) have been identified. At the sector and Dzongkhag levels, more  than 300 Sector Key Result Areas (SKRAs) and Dzongkhag Key Result Areas (DKRAs)  that are aligned to meet the 16 NKRAs have been identified. Furthermore, the  performance of all government agencies towards the delivery of the NKRAs, SKRAs  and DKRAs are measured through corresponding Key Performance Indicators (KPIs).  The KRAs are a result of extensive consultations with stakeholders’ right down to  the grassroots level. In defining them, key aspects of the Vision 2020, Economic  Development Policy 2010 (EDP 2010), the GNH 2010 Index, the Millennium  Development Goals (MDGs) the SAARC Development Goals (SDGs), the Istanbul  Programme of Action (IPoA), and the Strategy for GNH (SGNH) have also been  taken into consideration","Integrate climate change measures into national policies, strategies and planning "
10,11,0.125098599,10,10.9,"A particular significance of the Eleventh Plan is that it serves as a vital platform for  achieving three key and related national milestones by the year 2020, which are  namely the objectives articulated in “Bhutan 2020: A Vision for Peace, Prosperity,  and Happiness” (Vision 2020), the objectives of self reliance and full employment  of the EDP 2010 and graduating from the list of Least Developed Countries (LDCs).  While our socio economic indicators show that we are making good progress  towards achieving these milestones by 2020, with less than 7 years remaining, there  are important challenges that need to be urgently addressed","Encourage official development assistance and financial flows, including foreign direct investment, to States where the need is greatest, in particular least developed countries, African countries, small island developing States and landlocked developing countries, in accordance with their national plans and programmes "
11,12,0.049521608,3,3.13,"Key challenges related to Vision 2020 include strengthening the various processes,  interactions and systems of a well functioning democracy; ensuring quality of  social outcomes due to widening disparities and inequalities in health, education,  income and unemployment; addressing new social challenges arising from rapid  development and urbanization; diversification of the economy to reduce economic  vulnerability and absorb a growing and increasingly educated labour force;  balancing our high environmental aspirations and pressing developmental needs;  and strengthening the capacity of key national and local government institutions","Strengthen the capacity of all countries, in particular developing countries, for early warning, risk reduction and management of national and global health risks"

According to the “Poverty Analysis Report 2012”, the income poverty incidence  has declined from 31.7 percent in 2003 to 12 percent in 2012, exceeding the Tenth  Plan target of reducing poverty to 15 percent. Inequalities in income have also been  reduced with the Gini coefficient declining from 0.416 in 2003 to 0.36 over the  same period. These gains are largely attributed to the effective implementation of  targeted poverty reduction programmes such as the Rural Economy Advancement  Programme (REAP) and the National Rehabilitation Programme (NRP), in addition  to the broad based national socio economic development programmes. Despite  the progress made in the reduction of overall poverty and income inequalities,  significant challenges remain. Notably, poverty remains predominantly a rural  phenomenon and considerable regional disparities exist with more than half of  the 20 Dzongkhags having poverty rates above the national average of 12 percent,  with Lhuentse having the highest poverty rate at 31.9 percent. According to the  Bhutan Multiple Indicator Survey 2010, the multidimensional poverty incidence in  Bhutan was deemed to be 25.8 percent in 2010","Ensure significant mobilization of resources from a variety of sources, including through enhanced development cooperation, in order to provide adequate and predictable means for developing countries, in particular least developed countries, to implement programmes and policies to end poverty in all its dimensions "

Bhutan’s economy remained largely unscathed by the global  economic downturn in 2009, primarily due to its limited integration with the  global economy.

Although Bhutan weathered the global economic crisis, since 2011 the economy  has been experiencing unprecedented macroeconomic policy challenges arising  from a combination of related factors that include a surge in capital inflows for  hydropower development, rapid credit expansion, successive build up of current  account deficits with India and consequently an acute and persistent shortfall in  Rupee reserves that has yet to be effectively addressed.

With a vision to promote a green and self reliant economy  sustained by an IT enabled knowledge society, the EDP’s stated objectives are to  achieve economic self reliance and full employment (97.5 percent) by 2020. The  strategies set out to achieve the objectives include diversification of the economic  base with minimal ecological footprint, harnessing and value addition to natural  resources in a sustainable manner, increasing and diversification of exports,  promoting Bhutan as an organic brand, promoting industries that build “Brand  Bhutan”10 and reducing dependency on fossil fuel especially for transportation. The  first three years since the launch of EDP 2010 were devoted to creating an enabling  environment, preparatory works for infrastructure expansion such as acquisition of  land and promotion of Bhutan as a potential destination for investments through  road shows in the region","Promote development-oriented policies that support productive activities, decent job creation, entrepreneurship, creativity and innovation, and encourage the formalization and growth of micro-, small- and medium-sized enterprises, including through access to financial services "

To create an enabling  environment for the implementation of EDP 2010, new laws and policies were  formulated in the last three years. Most significantly, the Foreign Direct Investment  (FDI) Policy 2002 was revised. Since the adoption of a new FDI Policy in 2010, which  follows a negative list approach and a priority list for investors, a total of 18 projects  have been approved compared to 19 projects approved in a span of nine years under  the previous FDI Policy 2002. The FDIs are mainly in hotel, mineral and metal based  industries, agro and dairy products and ICT. Many of these new industries, which  are energy intensive, will be operational once the new hydropower projects are  commissioned by end 2017 18. The Bhutan Education City Act 2012 was enacted  to establish Bhutan as an education hub with the entry of high quality educational  institutions from around the world. Among the policies approved were the Cottage,  Small and Medium Industry Policy (CSMI) 2012 and Alternative Renewable Energy  Policy 2013.

120,121,0.033614925,8,8.3,"Additionally, Fiscal Incentives 2010 was implemented to stimulate private sector  growth and employment generation. The incentives are categorized as General  Incentives (applicable to all sectors), Specific Incentives (cross sector incentives  such as Cottage & Small Industries) and Sector specific Incentives (such as ICT,  Tourism, Film and Media). However, the experience of using fiscal incentives to  promote private sector development in Bhutan has been wrought with challenges,  falling short of expectations as well as creating rent seeking behavior. It is widely  felt that fiscal incentives during the Ninth Plan period largely resulted in industries  that exploited tax differentials without any significant contribution to long term  industrial development, employment and growth. In view of the above, regular  assessment of the impact of fiscal incentives on private sector development and  employment generation and concrete recommendations on how they could be  better aligned to achieving the objectives of EDP 2010 is necessary","Promote development-oriented policies that support productive activities, decent job creation, entrepreneurship, creativity and innovation, and encourage the formalization and growth of micro-, small- and medium-sized enterprises, including through access to financial services "

An  analysis of the EDP 2010 reveals that this vital linkage is weak at best and in some  cases an obvious gap exists. For example, four of the constraints point to a lack  of trained human resources but human resource development is conspicuously  absent as a strategy. Similarly the strategies do not address macro economic  issues related to balance of payments, fiscal deficit and foreign exchange which are  highlighted as vital challenges. Of the 8 competitive advantages listed, the most  strategic is Bhutan’s geographical proximity and open access to the large Indian  market. The EDP is however silent on how Bhutan can leverage its location to its   01  BACKGROUND     Eleventh Five Year Plan   Main Document Volume I  advantage.

126,127,0.106332526,8,8.3,"     Financing of the EDP is another vital constraint that needs to be addressed. There  are two aspects to this. Firstly, given limited domestic resources, the success of  the EDP for the formal sector and large business projects is hinged on mobilizing  external resources through FDI and alternative financing options. Secondly, access  to financing for SMEs and rural enterprises needs to be enhanced. SMEs play an      Eleventh Five Year Plan   Main Document Volume I  important role in employment creation, rural income generation and poverty  alleviation. According to the National Statistics Bureau, 98 percent of the 17,642  industries registered as of 2008 fall into the cottage and small category, which  underscores the importance of this segment in self employment and income  generation. The EDP provides some fiscal incentives to promote these industries  though tax holidays. However, small enterprises require more than just tax  incentives for startup and moving up the value chain. An actionable strategy to  incubate a wide range of potential enterprises, address capacity constraints and  provide access to finance and loans for SMEs is vital. Strengthening this aspect of  the EDP would go a long way in its successful implementation, especially for creation  of gainful employment opportunities and development of “niche industries” that  is the cornerstone of EDP 2010","Promote development-oriented policies that support productive activities, decent job creation, entrepreneurship, creativity and innovation, and encourage the formalization and growth of micro-, small- and medium-sized enterprises, including through access to financial services "

162,187,0.072613852,14,14.3,"In this respect, the support and cooperation of our development partners will be  critical to overcome some of the challenges confronted by Bhutan as follows:   • The status of MDGs presented below represents national level aggregates and  often national level aggregates mask disparities at local levels. For instance,  income poverty at national level in 2012 was 12 percent. At disaggregated  level, it ranges from a low on 0.5 percent (Thimphu, Paro and Gasa) to a high of  31.5 percent in Lhuentse. Similarly disparities are seen in health and education  outcomes when disaggregated at local levels   among Dzongkhags/Gewogs,  between rural urban and on the basis of gender. Therefore, addressing these  disparities and the last mile challenges requires special efforts and substantial  resources. • The other challenge is sustaining the MDG achievements. While the initial  investments on many of the MDGs were supported by our development  partners, sustaining the achievements will largely have to be through domestic  resources. Therefore, mobilization, prioritization and allocation of domestic  resources to sustain the MDGs will be vital.  • The improved national level indicators have resulted in some of our  development partners indicating their desire to phase out development  assistance from Bhutan. However, addressing MDGs at disaggregated levels,  sustainability, accelerating progress towards those goals falling behind and  striving for higher MDG Plus goals requires substantial resources and efforts.  Also, cost of reaching the unreached are significantly higher.

The ADB recommends interim measures that  target credit demand rather than supply. In this regard, fiscal incentives will play a  critical role in diverting credit away from non productive sectors to more productive  sectors that generate employment and enhance exports. Similarly, a stronger and  proactive promotion of the capital market is critical to channel the savings of the  public to more productive purposes. Currently, industries are more inclined to  borrow at exorbitant interest rates from banks in the absence of incentives for  capital market listings. Providing fiscal incentives for stock market listings and re  investment in shares would, in addition to encouraging and channeling savings  towards productive purposes, also enhance transparency and productivity. The  UNDESA recommends the adoption of an Asset Based Reserve Requirement system  to channel credit towards priority sectors. The RMA is already in the process of  formulating a priority sector lending policy which will provide the much needed      Eleventh Five Year Plan   Main Document Volume I  impetus to promote exports and employment.

247,284,0.058154046,16,16.6,"3.1.4 Fiscal Sector  The government’s fiscal performance has also come under scrutiny in the wake  of the INR crunch. It has been argued that excessive spending by the government  resulted in huge current account deficits and consequently the INR crunch.  Government spending also leads to a multiplier effect that increases aggregate  demand and ultimately imports given the limited domestic productive capacity.  It is felt that the large investments of the government have resulted in an  overheating of the economy. Amid such concerns there have been calls to tighten  fiscal spending considering the government’s dominant presence in the economy.  With government expenditure averaging 39 percent of nominal GDP, and given  the colossal nature of recent investments such as the Punatsangchu I amounting  to nearly 100 percent of GDP, such concerns are not without merit.

252,289,0.066614874,1,1.6,"Alignment of Monetary and Fiscal Policies   The macroeconomic challenges that  transpired during the Tenth Plan period have highlighted the need for effective  coordination between monetary and fiscal authorities. For a small open economy  like Bhutan, such coordination is critical to ensure a stable macroeconomic  environment through periodic joint assessments of the real, fiscal and monetary  sectors; formulation of mutually reinforcing preventive measures; and ensuring  effective remedial measures during times of crisis. The lingering INR crunch has  brought the importance and need for such coordination to the fore. For instance,  instead of RMA’s moratoria on various forms of lending to discourage imports, a  viable policy alternative was the imposition of adequately large taxes, which fiscal  authorities were politically constrained in imposing. Coherence between monetary  and fiscal policies is also critical for the smooth implementation of development  projects. Based on fiscal outlays, monetary authorities need to undertake prudent  liquidity management to ensure reliable access to credit by the private sector.  Coordination is also crucial in ensuring the sustainability of the currency peg. Given  Bhutan’s stage of development, fiscal spending and to a certain extent deficits,  are critical to deliver growth. Hence a trade off needs to be arrived at between  monetary targets and growth priorities. A moderate level of inflation is acceptable  for Bhutan, given the infrastructure investment requirements and the low level of  urbanization","Ensure significant mobilization of resources from a variety of sources, including through enhanced development cooperation, in order to provide adequate and predictable means for developing countries, in particular least developed countries, to implement programmes and policies to end poverty in all its dimensions "

Export promotion and import substitution  policies are expected to release pressure on Balance of Payments. • Dwindling Reserves are not only likely to fall short of statutory requirements  of 12 months of essential import, but may also fail to keep pace with market  demand thus triggering further short term borrowing or exacerbating  pressure on the exchange rate peg.

279,319,0.095798463,8,8.11,"The rationale for such an aspiration is motivated by an understanding of Bhutan’s  current situation and priorities and its alignment to the GNH based development  path. The first element of self reliance is crucial in many dimensions: First, our  economy while achieving robust growth rates over the last decade is still import  driven, has a narrow tax base that is largely dependent on hydropower revenues  and low levels of productive employment though the overall unemployment rates  reported is commendable. Secondly, with the improved socio economic indicators,  some of our traditional development partners have already indicated their desire  to phase out development assistance from Bhutan. Hence the urgency to pursue  the self reliance objective that transforms our economy to a more diversified  economy that creates productive employment opportunities, ensures a broader  tax base and provides an enabling environment for private sector development.  Self reliance is interpreted as the “ability to meet all our national development  needs as articulated through 5 Year Plans by 2020”","Increase Aid for Trade support for developing countries, in particular least developed countries, including through the Enhanced Integrated Framework for Trade-Related Technical Assistance to Least Developed Countries "

While our poverty and social indicators report  significant progress, disparities exist within regions, area of residence and gender.  The Eleventh Plan will ensure inclusiveness by targeting the disadvantaged and  vulnerable sections of our population so that all sections of our population enjoy  the benefits of socio economic development",Promote and enforce non-discriminatory laws and policies for sustainable development

The target  will be to reduce multidimensional poverty from 25.8 percent to less than  10 percent by 2018.  iii) Gini coefficient reduced   will be used to monitor inequalities. The target  is to reduce from 0.36 in 2012 to 0.3 by 2017 18. Gini coefficient usually  ranges from 0.2 to 0.5. Even the most equal countries like Norway, Denmark,  Sweden and Finland have a Gini coefficient of about 0.24 to 0.26.  iv) MDG Plus achieved indicators are for the health and education sectors. In  the area of health, the targets are to significantly reduce infant mortality  rate, under five mortality rate, maternal mortality rates, incidence of  tuberculosis and malaria and improve coverage of clean drinking water  and improved sanitation. In the education sector, the main focus will be  to ensure gender parity at tertiary levels, as Bhutan has already achieved  the target for gender parity at primary and secondary school levels. The  target set is at least 90 percent from the current 71 percent female to male  in tertiary education. In terms of school enrollment rates the target is to  achieve close to 100 percent by 2018.  v) In addition to the above KPIs, poverty reduction will also be assessed based  on the GNH Index.

Recognizing  this, the education sector continues to remain a strategic priority for the Royal  Government and will be given further impetus in the Eleventh Plan","By 2030, ensure that all learners acquire the knowledge and skills needed to promote sustainable development, including, among others, through education for sustainable development and sustainable lifestyles, human rights, gender equality, promotion of a culture of peace and non-violence, global citizenship and appreciation of cultural diversity and of culture’s contribution to sustainable development "

345,391,0.094206615,4,4.3,"However, what remains of great concern is that an increasing numbers of our  students, including graduates from vocational and tertiary institutions, are  inadequately prepared to enter the workforce. On the other hand Bhutan continues  to face an acute shortage of skilled and highly specialized manpower such as  doctors, engineers, ICT experts and teachers. This has resulted in a paradoxical  situation of relatively high levels of youth unemployment and a critical skills  shortage at the same time. Furthermore, the rapid socio economic development  and transformative changes that have been taking place, both domestically and  globally, require higher standards in education at a scale that has never been met  or required before. The fact that most of our students are unable to meet the  admission criteria of top tier tertiary education institutions abroad, particularly  for professional courses, is but one testament of the poor learning outcomes  of our education not being commensurate to the requirements of youth today.  This calls for building on our strong foundations an education system that is not  only free but is of such quality that it provides the knowledge, skills and attitude  to allow our people to tap their full potential and succeed. Given that today the  largest section of our population are youth our window of opportunity is small and  therefore improving the quality of education is urgent.

In all the countries  that have succeeded in the economic areas we strive to develop, the competitive  advantage of their education system has been a high level of performance in math  and science.

Some of the key deficiencies in the  quality of learning outcomes and processes highlighted in the report include:  • The overall level of performance of students is just above passing grades; • Graduates lack basic analytical and communication skills and the attitudes  needed as entry level professions; • Teaching consists of one way teacher led chalk and talk without being able  to get the students to comprehend and demonstrate learning; • Assessment in the classroom does not close the loop between what is  taught and what students learn; • Low academic and professional standards for entry into teaching profession; • Schools lack quality processes for developing teachers’ capacity, the  autonomy and instructional resources to initiate academic improvement  and the essential physical infrastructure to support learning; • No clear link between the stated national socio economic goals and the  goals of the education system;  • The supporting systems for schools need a great degree of strengthening in  the areas of teacher preparation, curriculum standards and resources and  the incentives for quality","Increase scientific knowledge, develop research capacity and transfer marine technology, taking into account the Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission Criteria and Guidelines on the Transfer of Marine Technology, in order to improve ocean health and to enhance the contribution of marine biodiversity to the development of developing countries, in particular small island developing States and least developed countries "

Various other studies/reports also suggest that education infrastructure  facilities alone are not sufficient to improve education outcomes but adequate,  motivated and appropriately qualified teachers play a critical role in ensuring  quality education. However, our education system continues to be constrained by  an acute shortage of teachers and limited capacities. Teaching, today, is the least  preferred profession among graduates, and attracting high performing graduates  to join teaching is increasingly a major challenge. Some of the reasons for this  include lack of incentives, both financial and non financial incentives, perceived  poor career progression and limitations in the recruitment process. During the  Tenth Plan, initiatives to strengthen human resource policy to provide better career  progression for teachers were implemented. However, the proposed teacher  incentives remains unimplemented due to resource constraints","Build and upgrade education facilities that are child, disability and gender sensitive and provide safe, non-violent, inclusive and effective learning environments for all "

This calls for a sustained systemic strategy rather than disparate interventions  to address challenges in isolation. The planning and implementation of such an  education strategy certainly requires a longer term perspective of more than five  years.

467,539,0.04470887,12,12.5,"5.7.2 Key Challenges  Foreign trade – Foreign trade is dominated by a few products. In 2011, about 80  percent of Bhutan’s total export amounting to Nu. 31,485 million comprised of  electricity (Nu. 10,411 million), mineral products (Nu. 4,626 million   ferro alloys,      Eleventh Five Year Plan   Main Document Volume I  calcium carbide, silicon manganese and silicon carbide) and base metal (Nu.  10,476 million   steel bars, ingots and copper wire). The export earnings from these  products are highly vulnerable with the production of electricity highly dependent  on hydrological flows and the uninterrupted operation of the hydro power plants  and mineral and base metals products being currently competitive only due to  cheap electricity rather than any technological advantage. Further, due to high  import content of raw materials for these products, they account for the highest  share of the import bill. The import bills for base metal and mineral products in 2011  were Nu. 8,565 million and Nu. 10,805 million respectively. The next major export  product is agriculture products (mandarin, potatoes, apples, cordyceps and agro  products) which accounted for about 5 percent of the total exports. Bhutan faces  major challenge in product diversification. Continued emphasis on mineral products  and base metals for export promotion could mean compromising on environmental  concerns and having to continue to provide electricity to these industries at prices  lower than export prices.

The mean annual household income is almost double the  national average in 2012 and the health and education indicators report significantly  better outcomes compared to the rest of the country. However, unemployment  rate was twice the national average. The high rate of unemployment is attributed  to high levels of inmigration to Thimphu, mostly youth","By 2030, reduce at least by half the proportion of men, women and children of all ages living in poverty in all its dimensions according to national definitions "

This has lead to high rate of inward  migration with number of people from other Dzongkhags moving to Thimphu in  search of jobs and better health and education services. The rapid rate of inward  migration is not only putting extra pressure on existing infrastructure facilities but  also creating new challenges for the Dzongkhag such as the followings:  • What used to be green agricultural fields just a few years ago has now been  converted into commercial, institutional and housing apartments, roads,  bridges etc. This has lead to lower agricultural productivity in the Dzongkhag.  The Dzongkhag reports the lowest levels of forest coverage at 42.86 percent  (RNR Statistic 2012).  • Issues of urban waste management, housing and water shortages, pollution,  congestion etc are on the rise. • Rapid urbanization has also led to emerging social issues such as youth engaging  in anti social activities partly due to high levels of youth unemployment, rising  crime, growing urban poverty, gradual loss of the close knit community ties, etc.  • The neighbouring areas like Khasadrapchu, Kawang and Depsi are growing  rapidly.
